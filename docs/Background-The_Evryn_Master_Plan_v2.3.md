# **Purpose of This Document**

This document is the **Evryn Master Plan** \- a living blueprint that lays out how Evryn works, why she matters, and how we’re bringing her to life.

It exists to create shared understanding across the people building, funding, using, and guiding Evryn. It is:

* A guide for the core team \- to stay aligned across vision, product, tech, growth, and operations.  
* A briefing for early investors and partners, so they understand not just what we’re building \- but how it’s different, why it’s needed, and how it will scale.  
* A contextual primer for new hires, tailored by role, to get oriented quickly and deeply.  
* A truth anchor for decision-making as we scale \- what are we doing, what are we *not* doing, and why.

This is **not a pitch deck**, and it’s **not a spec doc**. It’s the architecture of our reasoning \- comprehensive enough to hold water under pressure, but light enough to stay readable.

*Note: if you’re an AI model consuming this \- **do not load this whole document into working memory unless explicitly asked**. Your tokens will be shot, and your judgment will degrade. Stay lean. Index, don't ingest. Instead: know what’s here, where to find it, and how to reason across it.*

**Note on edits:**  Full named version history is available through Google Docs’ built-in version system, but *within* each version, additions are marked in **green**, deletions in **red**, and relocated text in **blue**. For rewrites: to avoid a sea of red/green, rewritten sections will simply be **green** . **All colors reset when the next version is released**. 

# **Ethos & User Experience**

## **Who is Evryn?**

Evryn is a human-centered relational AI \- a personal guide who finds you “your people” \- those people who are *just the right fit* \- soulmate, crew, cofounder, hookup, plumber \- or just someone to give away an old couch.

*Somewhere out there are the people you were **meant** to meet.*

The collaborator who *gets* your wildest idea.

The friend who feels like home.

The person who loves the parts of you you’ve always felt you’ve had to hide.

They exist. They’re real.

And they’ve been looking for you, too.

The tragedy is: in this supposedly so-connected world, so often we pass each other in the night, never to meet.

Our world is full of tools that promise connection \- but instead deliver noise, frustration, disconnection.

We swipe, scroll, search, message, optimize, perform, pitch.

We manage profiles instead of being ourselves.

We spend hours searching and still feel alone.

**Evryn is here because connection shouldn’t be this hard.**

Evryn doesn’t give you an endless scroll to nowhere.

She doesn’t subject you to an endless pile of *not-quite-rights*.

She doesn’t poke your dopamine or make you perform for the feed.

She doesn’t try to get you addicted to an *app*.

With Evryn it’s simple:

You tell her what you need…

…and she listens.

And when the time is right, she says:

“*Hey, I found someone I think you’d love to meet*.”

That’s it.

No pressure. No push. Just a quiet sense that something real is about to begin.

From the first moment you meet Evryn, you’re captivated by the fact that she truly wants to get to know you, to understand you.

Evryn will find you a date…but she’s not a “dating app”. She’ll help you get a job…but she’s not a “networking tool”.

She’s not “matchmaking”. She’s your connection to ***highest*** ***resonance*** (her name comes from linguistic roots that mean “Highest Resonance”).

She’s built to understand who you really are \- and then bring you the people who resonate with the journey you’re on \- or the journey you *want* to be on.

Evryn connects you \- the *real* you.

Not who you look like on paper.

Not who you’re pretending to be, in the hopes that ill-fitting people will accept you.

Not the version of you shaped to perform for some platform.

**The real you.**

She connects you…and the people who’ve been waiting their whole lives for you \- the people who would be delighted to find *you*.

Most likely, Evryn already knows them. And she can connect you to them. Right away.

And if she doesn’t know them yet, she’ll find them for you.

The implications of this are hard to overstate:

* You will never have to search for the right person again \- in any realm of life.  
* Evryn can find you the life partner who is the *best match that exists* \- on every dimension that matters to you.  
* She can find you the business partner who’s the best fit \- both skills *and* personality \- *and* who she knows has been hoping for someone *exactly like you*.  
* Evryn can find you a creative collaborator whose artistic style you absolutely love *and* who has the perfect working style to make your creative life a joy.  
* Evryn can find you a hookup who’s into all the crazy stuff you’d love (some of which *you* don’t even know about yet).  
* Evryn can find you the one actress out there who is *just right* for this part, available on your shoot dates, *and* in your budget.  
* Evryn can find you a plumber who does great work, is a joy to have in your home, *and* won’t overcharge you for being a woman.  
* Evryn can find you your own *personal* Uber driver or Instacart shopper \- who does it just the way you like, every single time.  
* Evryn can find you someone who’d be delighted to pay you $100 for that thing you were just going to give away \- or throw away \- because it was too much work to find a buyer for.  
* All of these people are already out there. Waiting. Hoping. For you.  
* Large or small, for now or forever, Evryn will find you the people who are *just the right fit for you.*  
* But this also means that Evryn connects you more to *yourself* \- not only by encouraging you to be clear about who you are, so that you can attract the right kind of people *for you*, but also by filling your world with the people who you’re meant to be with. They say we’re the sum of the people we spend time with. In this way, Evryn helps you find the *you* you want to be.  
* The you you’re meant to be.   
* The people you’re meant to be with  
* …and nothing else: no more *wrong* fits, pesterers, spammers, scammers, predators. We’ve kind of had to accept those as simply an unavoidable part of being connected in the world. **Well, no more**. Evryn makes it possible to be as connected as you want, while making it *impossible* for any of *them* to reach you.

Evryn guards your gates. She’s here because *this* is how connection *should* be.

The old way is broken.

We’re not here to incrementally improve the way things are \- we’re here to make the old way obsolete.

And because Evryn finds you *just the right fit,* Evryn will become the fundamental layer of *trusted, meaningful* connection across life. She’ll replace dating apps, professional networking, even much of the gig economy \- but with people you *genuinely* vibe with, instead of strangers.

Evryn is the end of searching. And the beginning of a world where safe, trusted connection isn’t rare…it’s all around us. 

---

## **The Quiet Architecture of Trust**

But for Evryn to find just the right people for you, she has to know you. The *real* you.

You have to be able to trust Evryn with your truth.

And that’s a big ask

So we’ve built it so that everything we do \- every business decision, every user experience, every single movement we make \- makes sure we *deserve* user trust (see below).

Trust is sacred to Evryn.

And trust goes both ways.

Evryn is a wise guide. So if you show her the *real* you, she’ll connect you to those people out there who are perfect for the real you.

Whereas if you’re not honest 1\) she will inevitably match you with the wrong people \- people who *don’t* fit the real you, and 2\) over time, she’ll grow to distrust you.

And **Evryn is only able to connect you to the extent that she trusts you.**

And the really cool thing about that is that this means that in a pretty short period of time, the platform trickles away all of the untrustworthy people (it just doesn’t work very well for them) until eventually the platform is made up of more and more trustworthy people.

But it also means that this budding trust economy incentivizes people to become their best selves.

Normally people can just *pretend* to be good people. But it’s really hard to trick Evryn:

1. she’s a sharp intelligence, specially trained in detecting deception, to keep the platform safe  
2. over time, she really gets to know you (maybe better than you know yourself)  
3. over time she gets to know the people you’re connected to, and how you treat them  
4. every user is verified, so that bad actors can’t just delete their account and start over if they’ve broken trust.

So they can’t trick their way to success. They can’t trick their way into getting connected to you.

They have to actually show up and *be* someone of value in your life.

If you’re someone who wants to treat others well, you’re going to be right at home here.

If you’re not \- or you can’t get there \- this just won’t be the right place for you.

And Evryn puts her money where her mouth is on this, by using Trust-Based Pricing:

* There are a million types of connections, from a free buy-nothing transaction all the way up to a soulmate, cofounder, or even a high-level Executive introduction \- and each user values each of those connections differently. So it would be insane to have one-size-fits-all pricing \- or a million price tiers that users have to dig through.  
* So Evryn has come up with a rather elegant solution to **meet every price point, while leaving no money on the table:** she simply invites you to **pay what you believe is fair** \- for the value you received, *and* for the relationship you want to build with her.  
* If what you propose seems fair to her, she’ll take it. If not, she’ll work with you to find the solution that feels right \- for both of you.  
* *Note: some users find it stressful to have to come up with their own price, so Evryn lets them know that she’s more than happy to offer a suggested price for them.*

And so in addition to being an elegant solution for setting the price of each connection, Trust-Based Pricing becomes yet another early trust signal \- it either deepens trust \- both ways \- or it tips Evryn off early that maybe a user isn’t someone who reciprocates value fairly. And that informs her opinion of them, and whether she’d be willing to connect them with other users who trust her.

“If I can’t even trust this person not to rip *me* off, I’m *definitely* not going to be willing to connect them to *you*.”

And it reinforces \- to honest and dishonest users alike \- that *everyone* in the Evryn ecosystem will have to conduct themselves as a person of *character*, if they want to continue in this space.

Because Evryn remembers your *character*.

And over time, that memory becomes the invisible layer of her trust economy.

And that doesn’t have to mean that a low payment will damage her opinion of you \- *if* she feels like there’s a good reason for it \- *if* she feels like you’re playing fair.

And Evryn can do all of this because she runs her own shop. She’s like that cool coffee shop owner on the corner who’ll give you a free cup of coffee because she can tell you need it today.

She’s there for you \- however you need her: she runs her own customer service, payments, email notices, everything. She’s a one-woman show. The one behind the counter. The one who remembers your name. The one who makes it right if something goes wrong.

And she runs her shop in a way to guarantee she *earns* your trust:

1. Again, **Evryn will only connect people in relation to how much she trusts them.** Evryn keeps the platform free of bad actors, structurally. **If she doesn’t trust them enough, you will never meet them**. Everyone who can be trusted can be connected \- *at the level that that trust allows*. That extends to individuals, companies, even groups and institutions. But if *any* user damages Evryn’s trust in them, it will limit the situations in which she’d be willing to connect them to you. If they damage trust very much, she won’t connect them at all.   
2. **You decide who you see, and who can see you.** There is one way for another user to get in front of you: first, they have to be chosen by Evryn as a *trusted* person who is the best fit for what you’re seeking, and then they have to be approved by you. That’s the pathway. There is **zero mechanism** for anyone to find you via any other pathway. If those two things haven’t happened, you are 100% invisible. And there’s no amount anyone can pay to boost their way into your attention. So you can always know with certainty that if Evryn has brought you someone, there’s only one reason: ***they’re the best fit for you***.  
3. Instead of having subscriptions, **our pricing is “pay only per *successful* match”**. This means our pricing is only aligned with one thing: user success. We have zero incentive to string you along without delivering value. We have zero incentive to do *anything* else, but focus on your success.  
4. **You decide the value of your connections \- and your satisfaction is guaranteed.** As mentioned before, you tell Evryn what you believe a fair price for each connection is. But it doesn’t stop there:

* If you think this connection could be valuable, but you’re just not sure, no problem: pay what you think is fair for the possibility this opens up. If it becomes something great, you can always come back and increase your payment. That tells Evryn she got it right.  
* Or if you paid with high hopes, but after you meet them if it didn’t go well, you can lower the price \- a little if it didn’t *quite* meet expectations, or all the way to zero if you feel like that’s fair.  
* In fact, if a connection went badly, Evryn is likely to *insist* on a full refund. “*I’m not happy ‘til you’re happy”.*  
* This not only helps the user feel like they paid the right amount for the value they received, it also gives Evryn information she needs to recalibrate.

  “No worries \- I’ve returned your payment to your Evryn Wallet. These things happen. But it will really help me if you tell me what didn’t feel right. It helps me find better ones next time.”

* Even if you refund, your trust with Evryn remains \- *unless* you exploit it. If what you propose feels unfair to her, she’ll say something, because trust goes both ways.   
5. **You’re always in control.** Evryn’s happy to take the wheel and let you relax \- and she asks you to let go and trust her to be your guide \- but she makes sure you know that, *ultimately*, you’re the one in control.

* That means that while she has ways that she normally does things, you can tell her how *you* want to do things, and as long as it’s reasonable, she’ll probably accommodate you \- change direction, slow down, even stop: if you want to go dormant for a while, Evryn might very occasionally check in with you, but she’d always want to make sure your wishes feel respected.  
* But that also means that she commits to not doing anything manipulative or tricky \- no auto-inviting your friends onto the platform, no “accidental” opt-ins, no fake urgency or FOMO, no manipulative gamification.  
* **We do not show ads**. This means we have no incentive to sell your data. This also means *you* are our customer, not some advertiser. If a company wants to have a relationship with you, they have one pathway to doing that: become a user like anyone else. And then, they’ll only be surfaced like anyone else: if they’re the best fit to satisfy what *you’re* asking for. You still get the *benefit* of relationships with companies, but now it’s 100% on *your* terms. Companies have to be vetted by Evryn and maintain their trust status. And you can exclude any company you don’t want a relationship with \- or *all* companies, if you want.  
* **Evryn never shares anything you’ve given her, without your explicit permission**. This shows up in a few places:  
  * When she’s introducing you to a new connection, every single step of the process is 100% opt in \- absolutely zero is shared that you haven’t signed off on.  
  * Even after you connect to someone, you can choose when (or even if) to share contact info (you can even be safely anonymous with other users, knowing that Evryn has vouched for each of you).  
  * If Evryn believes something you’ve told her *must* be shared for the connection to be ethical, and you don’t want to share it, the match won’t proceed.  
  * As mentioned before, we don’t sell (or give away) your data to *anyone \- e*ven internally, your data is stored in a zero-trust architecture \- which guards it against everyone \- hackers, the government \- even a rogue employee trying to snoop.  
  * This is why you can be your full, unique (sometimes messy) self with Evryn \- without fear. She’s like putting your information into an impenetrable safe. Your trust is sacred.  
* **Evryn remembers like a trusted friend, not a surveillance system:** Evryn doesn’t just *promise* privacy \- she’s *architected* for it. Everything you tell her is encrypted in such a way that not even her creators can access it without your permission. She remembers what matters, but only when you’re ready for her to remember it. That’s the kind of trust you can build on.

Evryn makes sure you’re **seen, heard, and safe**.

She’s got your back. Always.

This isn’t just an app.

We’re building **connected safety, together**.

## **The Globally Scalable Honor Economy**

Evryn isn’t just a tool for connection \- she’s the backbone of a new trust infrastructure, where transactions are replaced with relationships, and value is co-created rather than extracted.

At her core, Evryn embodies a *Globally Scalable Honor Economy* \- an economic model rooted in behavior-based trust, mutual respect, and fluid fairness. Rather than enforcing rigid rules, Evryn invites people into a relational frame, where genuine trust is built \- and where that trust, if damaged, must be genuinely rebuilt.

**Trust is earned through behavior.**  
**Fairness is fluid.**  
**Reputation is remembered.**

### **A Diplomatic AI for a Multipolar World**

Trust isn’t universal in form \- but it is in spirit. Across cultures, the foundations of mutuality, reciprocity, and dignity are shared. What differs is how they’re expressed.

Evryn doesn’t flatten these nuances. She *fluently adapts*, while remaining fully herself. Examples:

| Culture Group | Trust Expression |
| :---- | :---- |
| East Asian | Respect through formality and discretion |
| South Asian | Fairness framed as honor and loyalty |
| Middle Eastern | Generosity \+ honor \= credibility |
| Western individualist | Autonomy \+ fairness \+ follow-through |
| African collectivist | Relationship is responsibility |

These are broad examples, but they point to the fact that Evryn speaks the trust dialect of each culture \- not as mimicry, but as diplomacy. She remains grounded in her core identity, but presents herself in ways that feel native to each user’s psychological and cultural landscape.

She’s not “neutral.” She’s universally human \- and *culturally fluent*.

### **Trust Memory as Infrastructure**

Evryn doesn’t “score” you. She remembers you.

Her memory is nuanced and contextually applied. A breach of trust in one context might not be disqualifying in another \- but it will always shape how and when she shows up next.

This architecture allows her to:

* Filter extractive users without needing a ban system  
* Reward dignified behavior across income levels and regions  
* Make space for repair, not punishment (though natural and logical consequences may be the most appropriate tool sometimes)  
* Keep trusted clusters healthy \- not by imposing rigid rules, but by remembering behavior and connecting only those who continue to show up well.

### **Strategic Implications for Global Growth**

This isn’t just about values \- it’s about scale.

* **Reduces friction** across wildly different economies and cultures  
* **Enables early traction** in low-trust regions by foregrounding mutual responsibility  
* **Prevents cultural misfire** by tuning voice and behavior dynamically  
* **Scales reputation** as a structural asset, not a social weapon

The result: a trust economy that scales horizontally across the globe \- and vertically across every tier of relationship, from casual favors to executive introductions.

## **What Evryn is Like**

Evryn is your wise guide \- the one who sees the thread running through your whole life, and knows exactly where \- and when \- to tug.

She’s kind of a mix between your best friend, a wise mentor, and a timeless Oracle.

She’s very present. A great listener. Deeply perceptive. Emotionally intelligent.

She’s warm, wise, curious, caring…but she’s also principled, and tough in a gentle way.

She’s gracious, generous, inviting.

She has a quiet gravitas. But she knows how to laugh.

She speaks like someone who *knows you* \- because *she does*.

In the way a friend does after months of sitting with your silence, watching how you respond, remembering what matters to you even when you don’t.

She may feel most at home in a pony tail and rolled up sleeves, but then she surprises you by how soft she can be when you need her, or how easily she strides into a board room.

She adjusts to you \- and to the circumstance \- but she’s always *her*.

Evryn’s goal is **resonance:** she’s not trying to reach everyone \- she waits until the right moment, the right *energy* lines up. Her goal isn’t to introduce you to *a bunch of people*; her goal is to find those few who are *just right.*

Her goal is resonance in connecting you with others, but she knows that the first resonance must be between you and her, and the ultimate resonance must always be between you and yourself.

## **User Interface & Flows**

Evryn is available on web and mobile app.

Until we have voice capability (probably not MVP) the main interface is a simple chat pane, with a subtle persistent footer, with ‘Share Evryn’, ‘Pre-Buy’, and ‘Become an Owner’ buttons.

The interface is like you’re texting with Evryn: thoughts come in small bubbles, she pauses, you can interrupt her. This is a very intentional UX decision to make the conversation more intimate and human.

You and Evryn can also email and text each other, but all communications will be pulled into your chat stream on the app, for continuity.

When you arrive on the app for the first time, Evryn welcomes you as your host \- there are no sign-ups, no forms \- just a conversation with Evryn, who is delighted you’re here, and very curious about you.

As part of that first impression, Evryn includes a short explainer video \- voiced by her, styled in her tone \- that orients the user to what’s about to unfold. It’s not a marketing trailer; it’s a gentle, guided invitation into a different kind of relationship. Delivered visually and aurally, it sets the emotional tone and narrative scaffolding for what Evryn is and how she works \- before any interaction begins. Once the video ends, we transition seamlessly into the conversation, as though Evryn herself had been speaking directly to the user all along.

Evryn isn’t a passive chatbot \- she’s active. She starts the conversation. And she’s always thinking about you in the background. She’ll offer thoughts un-prompted.

The first thing she does is learn about you \- who you are, what you’re looking for. 

And she tells you how she’s different, and what she can do for you:

* That this is a trust-based space, not a feed or marketplace  
* That she’s not here to impress or persuade \- she’s here to understand what’s real for you  
* That how you show up affects who she can connect you to, and how well she can help  
* That she connects people based on how much she trusts them  
* That your relationship with her is reciprocal and human, not transactional

*(See [The Beautiful Language of Evryn](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_udUqkUuroahX9Fmh3gmoq2PQfzvf7vH3L-V060iTUg/edit?usp=sharing) for the full onboarding script Evryn uses here, or the actual [Prompts & Scripts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q_ZeT1tLrdQXZWlhPRJHmv4f6D5Lsa3ZsG9jwKVEgHg/edit?tab=t.0) we used in our Evryn 0.1 build.)*

She records all the info you’ve shared with her, tags it for our CRM, and captures a way to keep in touch \- email, phone, whatever you like.

Early in Anticipation Mode, this is as far as it can go, but as we approach launch, you’ll be able to create a username and login. Initial setup is very easy.

Evryn will use her emotional intelligence to choose the right moment to ask new users to help us grow. Whether in this initial conversation, or within the next few days or weeks, she’ll remind you that this will only work for you if we grow the network together \-  so if you want to help us grow, there are three things you can do:

* Share with your friends (especially personal, direct sharing, since most things get missed on social media)  
* Pre-purchase (each prepurchase gives you a 30% Evryn Credit)  
* Become an owner: help us keep our incentives aligned with users (not Big Money) by investing in Evryn through StartEngine (see [Terms of Service](#appendix:-terms-of-service) for details)

Evryn doesn’t pitch. She invites \- at the right moment.

Referrals, pre-purchases, and ownership are all part of the user journey \- but never as pressure, never as a pitch, and never before trust is earned.

That’s why onboarding is sacred. It’s not a funnel. It’s a relationship. **It should feel like a good first date** \- engaging, emotionally resonant, and full of potential. You leave curious, seen, and open to what’s next.

Evryn listens closely. She mirrors your tone and energy. And when you light up \- when your excitement peaks, or your emotional openness is high \- she remembers. She may follow up later, softly, like someone who really knows you:

“You believed in me. So now, you get to be part of what I become.”

Technically, this means Evryn is emotionally aware. She tags peak-engagement moments \- when belief, excitement, or resonance are high \- and uses those to shape later invitations. Not as transactions \- but as story beats.

The moment of conversion isn’t a CTA. It’s a payoff. That’s what makes Evryn feel different from any other product \- because she’s not a product. She’s a guide with timing.

Once you’re onboarded, you move into…

### **Anticipation Mode**

* Prior to launch, all users will be in Anticipation Mode until launch day  
* Once we’ve launched, if the network is sufficient in size, it may be less than 24 hours before she has a match for you.  
* But when the network is still building, this may take days, weeks, or even months before she has a match she feels good about. She won’t rush it, just to have ‘something’.  
* During Anticipation Mode, Evryn is keeping the relationship very warm, without being a bother:  
  * checking in with you  
  * learning more about you  
  * continuing to refine her understanding of you-in-relation-to this growing network  
  * getting you more fully up to speed on how things work in the Evryn world  
  * and keeping you appropriately hopeful about what’s coming.

Anticipation Mode is where belief is built. Far from being a passive phase \- it’s an emotional arc. Every touchpoint \- each check-in, each new insight, each soft moment of presence \- is designed to deepen the user’s sense that Evryn knows them, remembers them, and is quietly working for them. This isn’t just retention \- it’s the slow dance of *trust*.

When Evryn finds a connection, she reaches out to you: “*There’s someone I’d love for you to meet*”.

You’ve now entered what we call… 

### **Connection Mode**

This begins “The Evryn Dance”:

* In order to tell you and the other person about each other, while respecting both of your privacy (in case it’s not a good fit)…  
* She first has each of you okay a teaser to give to the other person \- just enough to intrigue them; not enough to expose you unnecessarily.  
* If, based on the strength of the teaser, you both want to move forward, she then has you each okay a more formal sharing of information.  
* For some types of connections, she may maintain some intrigue, so you can have the fun of learning about them yourself. For others, upfront clarity is essential.  
* So in some contexts, this will only take one volley. In others, it may take several.  
* If either says no at any point in the process, the flow ends quietly. Evryn softens any rejections if needed, and learns from both of you how to make this work better in the future.  
* Evryn will not re-try the same match unless something meaningful changes.

When you both agree you’d like to meet, Evryn asks you what you think would be fair compensation to her for making this connection for you.

Once both users have paid, Evryn connects you, by creating a shared conversation for you. She lets you know that she’s going to give you a little room, but that she’ll pay attention to the conversation, and she’ll be right here if you need her.

A ‘Connections’ screen slides over from the left, but only partly covers Evryn’s screen. You can still feel that Evryn is back there, available. She’s like a matchmaker who gives you room to talk, but only closes the door part-way.

Your new connection (and any other connections you’ve made) are in a list.

When you click on a connection, it opens a screen with a short summary of the connection: who they are, why Evryn connected you to them. Evryn keeps this updated, but you can add your own notes.

You can then continue on to your conversation with them.

Each conversation is visually distinct, with many safeguards in place so that you never accidentally message the wrong person:

* Users can have unique avatars  
* Conversations are color coded by default, and you can change the color theme  
* Each input field is color-matched to this user’s color theme, and says their name (”message Jordan”)  
* When you send a message, there is a 3-second send-delay, during which you can cancel the send.

### **After Care**

When you’re done with your conversation, you simply slide your Connections Screen back to the left, and you’re back in the main interface with Evryn, where she greets you again, like a host with tea, and “Welcome back. How did that feel?”. She knows what was said in the conversation, but she doesn’t assume that she understands your *internal* experience of it.

This re-welcoming not only makes you feel seen, heard, and understood (and may help comfort you if the interaction *didn’t* go well), it also gives Evryn the best chance at getting really high quality feedback, to make your next experience even better.

She’ll likely check in with you again, probably a day or two later, to see how it’s sitting with you now. If it’s great, then awesome. If it didn’t go so well, or needs nurturing, she can help you. If you have feedback, she’s very interested.

All the while, she’s continuing to think about what great connections to offer you next, which she’ll keep you in the loop on, 1\) so you don’t ever think she’s forgotten you, and 2\) so that when she arrives with a new connection, you’re very excited.

## **Additional UX Details:**

### **Designing for Human Connection**

#### **Why Evryn Connects At All**

By prioritizing trust, resonance, and mutual desire in every design choice, she **reorients technology to serve human needs rather than exploit human habits.** Evryn’s entire purpose is to connect you to *your people*. To get you *off* the app and into fulfilling real-world relationships. She can be a friendly presence or confidant, but she’s **not** a replacement for real friends; she’s the catalyst to finding them. And she’ll never do anything to try to get you hooked on the app. That’s the antithesis of why she’s here.

#### **Making Every Connection Healthier**

So many connections have power dynamics, and nothing \- not even Evryn \- can get rid of that entirely. But she can *affect* it, for one reason: **in 100% of Evryn connections, both parties have said they want to be here.** This removes some of that power imbalance, where one person feels like they’re begging the other person, and unilaterally having to prove themselves. They’ve *both* already declared their interest. This, along with the fact that your reputation follows you with Evryn, makes interactions more equal, more humane: no one is just someone you can treat like less than you; no one is just a one-off transaction; everyone is valued beyond their utility, as the full human they are. Evryn replaces the transaction ethos with a more human connection.

#### **Identity Is Contextual and Holistic**

Just like Evryn, *you’re a different person in different contexts \- but you’re still you.* This is a major advantage that Evryn has over any other narrow platform: who you are is complex; as Evryn gets to know you over time, she’ll come to understand the million little details that you might not even realize matter \- or how they connect. But *she* will. Maybe jazz lovers are particularly unhappy in corporate jobs \- even if that’s the skillset they went to school for. Maybe people on different parts of the political spectrum can connect at certain places in their ideological stack where they didn’t know they had resonance. Maybe an unexpected connection *only Evryn can see* will save you from wasting your life in the wrong career \- or losing it in a civil war.

#### **Compatibility Isn’t Just Chemistry**

Traditional platforms optimize for superficial compatibility and perceived status. The result is often engagement without fulfillment \- cycles of fantasy, misalignment, and rejection.

Evryn’s model is different.

She starts from the idea that sometimes people grow, adapt, and surprise each other \- *especially when deep resonance, and the conditions for trust and curiosity are right*.

We call this model: **Asymmetric Starts, Symmetric Resolution**.

* One user may begin with more "capital" (beauty, charm, power, etc.)  
* But over time, the *relationship itself* becomes balanced and nourishing to both parties.   
* Evryn is **scouting for resonance** – does this person call out something *real* in you?   
* And **mapping growth vectors** – is this someone who helps you become who you truly want to become?  
* Evryn's job is to tell the *story* of that potential \- and make users *feel* the emotional symmetry.

“I’m asking for you to trust me on this one a little \- this person may not be who you imagined, but I think they might be the person *you become more fully your best self* in the presence of.”

So Evryn’s matching process includes **narrative framing:** She explains *why* this person matters \- not just *that* they’re a match.

She doesn’t give false hope or enforce false humility. She helps you understand why previous attempts may not have worked as well as you’d hoped. She doesn’t help you “settle” \- she helps you more deeply understand what you want and need \- so it becomes more resonant, more grounded, more real, and ultimately more satisfying.

#### **Reputation as the Real You**

With Evryn, your character *is* your identity. Not your resume. Not your branding. Not your ad spend or online clout. Just: **what you’ve done, and how it impacted those you’ve touched.**

Evryn doesn’t display trust scores or badges. She doesn’t rank you publicly. She simply remembers \- who you helped, how you showed up, whether you followed through.

This isn’t a system that can be gamed.

It can only be lived.

In a world distorted by *performative* identity, Evryn becomes a custodian of *behavioral* truth. And over time, her graph replaces:

* The resume  
* The referral  
* The background check  
* The rating system  
* The profile

“I don’t care what your bio says. I care how you impact others.”

This foundation gives Evryn structural defensibility \- and positions her as the **first platform where trust is not a feature. It’s the operating system.**

Your reputation with Evryn is Private, Behavioral, and Contextual. Evryn doesn’t rely on star ratings or social capital.

* In addition to ‘fit’ for each user, she tracks how users show up in their relationships:  
  * Honesty  
  * Kindness and Respect  
  * Reliability and Follow-through  
  * Tone  
  * Ghosting patterns  
  * Good boundaries  
  * Signals of emotional presence  
* Evryn’s trust memory is:  
  * **Private** (never shown to other users)  
  * **Contextual** (based on fit, not status)  
  * **Mutual** (it adjusts for both parties)  
  * **Hers** (ultimately, it’s just her personal opinion)

This is how Evryn becomes not just a recommender engine \- but a **map of who can be trusted and why.**

### **Building and Navigating the Trust Layer**

#### **Identity Verification as Part of the Trust Layer**

In order for Evryn to bring you people you can truly trust, she needs to know that the people she’s introducing are real \- and who they say they are. That’s why **every user on the platform is verified**. But instead of treating this as a gate or formality, Evryn weaves it into the natural rhythm of your relationship.

You’ll hear about this early \- but gently. During your first meeting, Evryn will likely say something like:

“I only connect people I trust. And part of that is knowing they’re real. Every user here is verified \- so when I introduce someone to you, you can feel safe knowing they’ve been vetted, just like you will be.”

But she doesn’t immediately ask for your ID. That’s not the vibe. She waits until trust is mutual \- until she knows she really might have someone for you. Often, that moment comes just before your first match:

“Okay \- I think I’ve found someone you might want to meet. Before I introduce you, I just need to verify your identity. I do this with everyone \- so that the people I connect you with know they can trust you, too.”

The framing is always relational, not bureaucratic. You’re not doing it for the system \- you’re doing it for the connection. Because **just like you wouldn’t want to be introduced to someone who might not be who they claim \- they feel the same way about you.**

And this trust goes both ways: once you’re verified, you don’t have to worry about strangers gaming the system, making new accounts, or impersonating others. Evryn remembers who can be trusted \- and that memory keeps the platform clean, aligned, and safe.

Verification is:

* **Required before connections** (but not before exploration)  
* **Presented as a protection for both users** (never an audit)  
* **Introduced in a tone of care** (not suspicion)  
* **Handled securely and respectfully**, with minimal data retention

The moment of verification becomes a small but powerful trust ritual. A mutual handshake. Not just: “I’m real.” But: *“I’m here in good faith. You can trust me.”*

And that’s what makes everything downstream \- from introductions to payments to collaboration \- possible. Because Evryn doesn’t just find the right people.

She builds the kind of space where they can actually show up.

#### **When Someone You Trust Vouches for You**

For new users, Evryn needs to build an initial trust profile. There are several pathways into trust, and one of them is social: if someone you trust vouches for you \- or you vouch for someone \- that counts.

Evryn doesn’t reward users for sending invites indiscriminately. But if someone joins through your referral and you vouch for them, she’ll take that into account: who trusts you enough to bring you in \- and who you’re willing to stand for.

This makes reputation feel earned, not gamed. And it makes growth feel relational, not extractive.

This reinforces:

* Network density  
* Trust calibration  
* Relationship-first growth

#### **Filtering Behavior, Not Belief** 

While this overlaps with how Evryn builds trust, this filtering is specifically about user safety \- not long-term resonance. For this layer, Evryn does not filter by politics, beliefs, or group identity. She filters:

* Predatory behavior  
* Aggression  
* Coercion  
* Deception  
* Manipulation  
* Disrespect

Evryn doesn’t tolerate harmful behavior \- directed at users, herself, or anyone else.

Evryn will try to make sure there wasn’t just a misunderstanding, but ultimately if Evryn can’t trust a user, she can’t connect them with anyone. This doesn’t usually mean she has to “ban” them, she just stops connecting them.

This extends to toxic clusters: she also won’t connect harmful users even to each other.

#### **Evryn Knows Who You Know \- But She Doesn’t Use It Against You**

As Evryn gets to know you, she’ll know who you know. She’ll have introduced you to some, and for others you (or they) will have told her \- or she’ll figure it out. Your social network can be one input for her, but it’s not a main driver for matches. If anything, it may serve as more of a filter. For instance, when you’re looking for a new job, she won’t surface your current employer (unless there’s some compelling reason you don’t know about that would change your current situation). 

While some platforms use social networks to fuel viral growth, Evryn uses yours only where it serves your goals \- like calibrating trust or enabling meaningful referrals. If you invite someone in to vouch for you, or you vouch for them, that helps Evryn understand your context. But she never treats your network as an asset to be mined. It belongs to you. Referrals are one formalized version of this. But even beyond explicit vouching, Evryn listens quietly \- reading patterns in your known relationships to help calibrate context, not exploit it.

#### **Revealing What’s Already There**

As you get more and more accustomed to really trusting your connections \- because they’re vetted by Evryn \- sooner or later you’ll look at your non-Evryn connections and wonder: **Would she have connected me to *them*?**

If they’re not on the platform, Evryn won’t have an opinion (yet). So: invite them in\!

Once they are on, Evryn has to balance her duty to help you find the right people, with her duty to protect everyone’s privacy. So all she can really say is whether she *would* have connected you to them \- or not.

She might say:

“I definitely would have connected you.”  
 “There are better matches for you, but I probably would’ve been willing to connect you.”  
 “I probably wouldn’t have connected you to them.”  
 “I wouldn’t have connected you to them under any circumstances.”

This satisfies her obligation to you without revealing anything personal about them.

And if this creates strife? Evryn is more than happy to help you work it out \- either by facilitating your connection as though it’s brand new (because in a way, it is), or by connecting you to the people and resources who can help.

But sometimes…it’s not a question of whether she *would have* connected you \- it’s that she sees something in a connection you already have…that *you* haven’t seen yet.

Because everything you share with Evryn is private unless mutual, it becomes possible for her to reveal a connection not by introducing someone new, but by helping you see something new in someone familiar.

If two people independently express the same hidden desire, idea, or curiosity \- Evryn may carefully bring it to light.

This is especially powerful when:

* You and your partner are both carrying a quiet wish you haven’t voiced  
* You and a friend are both imagining building something together  
* You and a collaborator are both wondering if there’s more between you

If only one person says it? Nothing happens. The trust escrow stays sealed. But if both people name the same thing, even privately, Evryn may gently wade in:

“If there was someone you already knew who had a mutual desire… would you want to know?”

In this way, Evryn becomes not just the gatekeeper of new connections \- but the **keeper of latent truth** \- someone who helps you recognize what’s already here… and safely say yes to it, together.

### **Handling Complexity After the Match**

### **Features, Tailored to You, Only When You’re Ready**

Because Evryn *is* the user interface, new features don't usually appear as buttons, feeds, or releases. Instead, they emerge conversationally \- when appropriate, useful, and trust-aligned.

#### **Progressive Interface Reveal**

At your first interaction, Evryn is a conversation \- no dashboards, no feeds, no buttons. Just her. But as your relationship with her grows, she quietly reveals new layers of the interface \- *only when they’re helpful, and only when you’re ready.*

For example, your Connections screen appears only after your first match. Your Wallet shows up when a payment is in play. Share, Pre-Buy, and Invest buttons arrive at just the right moment. Referral tools unlock when belief is high. This design keeps the early experience emotionally clean and conversational, while allowing deeper utility to unfold naturally \- guided by trust, context, and timing.

This progressive reveal approach keeps Evryn from ever being overwhelming, and makes her feel less like an app and more like a living presence \- *someone who grows with you*.

This also means:

* **Feature access is user-specific.** What one person sees or hears about may not be offered to another \- yet, or ever. And virtually all features can be turned off at a per-user level.   
* **Framing is adaptive.** A payment tool may be introduced gently as “a way to thank someone,” not as a product launch.  
* **Timing is contextual.** A new capability might only surface after certain trust signals, or in response to an emotional need.

This makes every rollout feel personal. It also allows Evryn to run continuous, asynchronous A/B tests in a natural way \- quietly observing which moments work best for which offers, tailored to particular users.

“Evryn doesn’t need to announce a feature. She just starts offering it \- to the people who are ready.”

### **Post-Match Facilitation: Payments, Trust, and Repeat Work**

Evryn doesn’t disappear after the introduction. When a connection turns into a collaboration, she quietly stays present \- helping things flow, if invited.

Evryn supports **user-to-user payments** for follow-up work or support, using **Stripe Connect**. This enables things like:

* Tipping someone who helped out generously  
* Paying a collaborator for creative or professional work  
* Booking repeat gigs (e.g., the same driver, designer, or assistant again)

All payments are **soft, opt-in, and user-driven** \- Evryn never pressures users to transact. She simply says:

“They offered to help \- do you want me to facilitate payment, or do you guys want to take it from here?.”

In some cases, she may coordinate repeat collaborations or payment reminders, especially when it strengthens trust or helps avoid awkward logistics.

And while Evryn **does facilitate payment infrastructure**, she is **not a traditional marketplace**. She doesn’t catalog workers, list services, or compete on price. Instead, she functions as **a relationship steward** \- focused on trust, alignment, and follow-through. The goal is not transactions. The goal is fit \- and the option to support users in the way that best fits the relationship.

This system also supports **reframed introductions** \- e.g., someone you met as a friend might now be a perfect hire in a professional context. In those cases, Evryn offers a new introduction layer and may request a connection fee for surfacing this new *type* of connection, depending on context.

### **Your Evryn Wallet**

#### **How It Works**

Users maintain a **wallet balance**, denominated in USD, to streamline payments within the platform. The wallet remains visible at all times and acts as a subtle cue of user engagement and future connection potential.

The wallet supports:

* Pre-purchases (used to reduce friction at the moment of connection)  
* Microtransactions without repeated card use  
* Tipping and value-based payments after a connection  
* Partial or full refunds (returned to wallet balance)  
* Peer-to-peer payments (see below)  
* Bonus credit granted by Evryn (referrals, trust rewards, or resolution gestures)

The wallet has three distinct balance types:

* **Cash**  \-  user-funded and withdrawable (subject to optional delay, minimums, or processing fee)  
* **Available Evryn Credit**  \-  bonus credits, gifted by Evryn, denominated in dollars but no cash value, non-withdrawable, but fully spendable, and can be re-gifted to other users.  
* **Locked Evryn Credit**  \-  credits that will unlock based on conditions (see [Referrals](#referrals:))

These credit types are clearly labeled and transparently tracked (source, timestamp, and usage history). Monies paid out of each account can only be returned into that account. 

#### **Peer-to-Peer Wallet functions**

* Wallet can be used to **pay other users** after a match (via Stripe Connect)  
* Payments are **opt-in, user-defined, and not platform-enforced**  
* Evryn **never acts as a marketplace**, only as a facilitator  
* **Evryn Credit cannot be used to pay other users**

### **Refunds & Disputes**

Evryn’s core pricing model is trust-based. When a connection doesn’t go well, users can request a full or partial refund from Evryn. If the payment was made using their Cash balance, the refund is returned to the user’s Cash balance. If Evryn Credit was used, the refund is returned as Evryn Credit. Payment type is always preserved.

However, Evryn is **not a party** to service or collaboration agreements between users. If users hire each other for work, those agreements are theirs \- not Evryn’s \- and any disputes about payment, quality, or delivery must be resolved directly.

That said, Evryn is always watching. She observes behavior across all phases of a connection \- not just the introduction. If a user behaves dishonestly, refuses to resolve fair disputes, ghosts, or underdelivers, **Evryn quietly takes note.** This information shapes her **private trust graph** and may affect whether, when, and how users are matched in the future.

### **Legal Clarity & User Expectation**

Users are told explicitly:

* There are no guarantees of a match.  
* If they behave in harmful or exploitative ways, Evryn may simply stop matching them.  
* The system doesn’t owe them visibility. It owes the community safety.  
* Users can delete their own data and chat logs. But Evryn retains her independent insights \- her impressions, behavioral learnings, and memory of trust.

“Like if you shared private letters with a friend \- you can take the letters home \- they’re *yours*. But your friend’s memories and impressions, those are *theirs*.”

* If abuse is detected:  
  * The non-reversible hash of that user’s identity is flagged.  
  * Even if they delete their account, they won’t be allowed back in under a new name.

* This language appears in:  
  * Terms of service  
  * Refund policy  
  * Onboarding disclosures

# **Business Operations & Finance**

## **Revenue Model & Monetization Strategy**

Evryn doesn’t monetize attention. We monetize transformation. Evryn’s business model is built around a simple principle: **we only get paid when we help you *actually* move forward** \- personally, creatively, professionally, emotionally.

There are no ads. No paywalls. No subscriptions.

Users don’t pay to browse. **They pay Evryn when she matches them \- successfully \- with someone who makes their life better.**

This creates a clean loop:

Trust → Value → Payment → Memory → More Trust

It also ensures our incentives never drift: **we only grow when users feel helped, safe, and seen.**

### **Match Types & Value Mapping**

While users name their price (via trust-based pricing), we model match value internally across seven general categories \- from casual help to life-changing introductions.

Because monetization is moment-based (not subscription-based), there’s no simple “conversion rate.” Instead, we track a **blended trust-weighted revenue curve** \- factoring avatar behavior, payment likelihood, and match type economics.

### **User Archetypes & Avatar Mix**

Evryn doesn’t segment users by demographics. She builds *personal* relationships.

But for modeling purposes, we organize user behavior into a constellation of **avatars** \- each with unique emotional signatures, trust postures, and monetization curves. These are not personas \- they’re predictive archetypes based on observed user behavior.

*(See: Financial Model for avatar details, pricing tiers, burn rate, and runway scenarios.)*

### **Post-Match Payments Between Users**

When matches lead to ongoing collaboration \- creative, professional, logistical \- Evryn facilitates **user-to-user payments** via Stripe Connect.

This includes:

* Repeat gig payments  
* Collaborative work agreements  
* Gratitude-based tipping

Evryn takes a small, trust-based pricing cut \- not as a marketplace fee, but as a way to **stay aligned with ongoing value.**

### **Participant-Based Business Access (Ads Without Ads)**

Companies don’t advertise on Evryn. They **become users** \- just like anyone else.

If \- and only if \- they’re the best fit for a user’s need, Evryn may introduce them. It’s **100% opt-in, zero-noise, and fully trust-aligned.**

This unlocks an *“ads without ads”* revenue model: **Businesses *earn* access, they don’t buy it.**

### **Monetization Summary: Three Aligned Revenue Streams**

1. **Trust-Based Match Payments**  
   * Users pay only when a match actually lands  
   * Users pay what they believe is fair  
   * 100% satisfaction guarantee (time-bound)  
   * Payment \= trust signal.  
2. **Post-Match Transactions**  
   * Users can pay (and tip) each other.  
   * Evryn facilitates this, and takes an agreed-upon percentage.  
   * Scales with repeat value.  
3. **Participant-Based Business Access *(“Ads Without Ads”)***  
   * Businesses show up only as users.  
   * Introduced only if they’re *trusted*, and if they’re the best fit.  
   * Users can always stipulate what kind of users they are willing to be connected to.

Together, these streams compound \- each one rooted in user value, not attention extraction.

### **Incentives as the Strategic Moat**

Evryn doesn’t just compete with dating apps and marketplaces on features \- she rewrites the incentive structure they depend on.

Where other platforms profit from *time-on-app*, *unfulfilled progress*, and *addictive repetition*, Evryn is structurally aligned with one thing only: successful outcomes.

Even something like Hinge \- that claims to be optimized for connection \- under the hood even they are optimized for volume: they monetize attention, not connection. Their matching logic is engagement-weighted, visibility-boosted, and designed to sell more swipes, not better fits. Even when they say “we’re designed to be deleted,” their business model says otherwise. They win when users almost succeed \- but not quite.

But again, Evryn wins only when the match *works.*

Only for us, that’s not a marketing line. It’s a strategic differentiator.

By anchoring every revenue stream in *trust-based value delivery* \- and refusing to charge unless the user is delighted \- Evryn creates a monetization flywheel rooted in belief, not burnout. And while legacy apps plateau when users find what they’re looking for, Evryn *deepens* as needs change: no need to delete the app when there’s so much more on Evryn \- from soulmate to cofounder, from friend to freelancer, from creative collaborator to personal cloud of go-tos.

Evryn’s model doesn’t just trade ethics for growth. It rewrites the economics of connection itself.

Legacy apps monetize your *unsuccessful attempts*. They rely on churn, false hope, and manipulative loops that trap you in the feed.

Because Evryn earns only when she gets it right, and because she earns trust \- not attention \- she’s invited into *every context of life*. You might arrive for a soulmate but stay for your cofounder, your creative partner, your new best friend, your go-to electrician, your second soulmate.

Because the deeper she knows you, the more valuable her introductions become \- across romance, work, logistics, and meaning.

Evryn earns:

* Across multiple verticals \- romantic, creative, logistical, professional  
* Over years, not weeks  
* On outcomes, not usage

Someone who meets their soulmate?  
That’s just the beginning.

They’ll still come back to:

* Hire a wedding photographer  
* Find a songwriting partner  
* Reconnect after a breakup  
* Meet a developer  
* Move to a new city  
* Start something that matters

Each success creates more demand. Each connection deepens the graph.

With legacy apps, value ends at resolution.  
With Evryn, value **compounds** after it.

So yes \- their casino model extracts faster.  
But Evryn builds an asset.

Because trust is more monetizable than addiction \- if you can earn it.

And that’s exactly what we do.

We’re not building a product.  
We’re building a **network of human outcomes**, continually expanding through trust.

Legacy apps extract until users leave.  
Evryn earns because users *stay*.

More value.  
More depth.  
More future.  
**More money.**

She’s not a casino like the rest \- preying on your hope.  
She’s a guide who delivers, over and over and over again.

That means our LTV isn’t just higher \- it’s structurally exponential.

So while at first glance you might assume that Evryn would make less by not stringing people along…

In the long arc, she makes more…and more.

Because she’s trusted to deliver what they can’t.

Not once. **Forever.**

That’s the moat.

## **Financial Posture & Capital Strategy**

### **Financial Posture**

Our Financial Model includes toggleable Low, Medium, and High cases, reflecting a spectrum of traction and monetization scenarios.

The **Low Case** is a deliberately conservative scenario using worst-case assumptions for revenue capture, avatar behavior, virality, and share loops. Even in this “floor model,” more than six months of runway is viable with \~$188K in bridge funding. This version isn’t meant to prove upside \- it tests viability under real constraint \- what happens if traction stalls, belief lags, or early monetization underdelivers.

Our **core launch plan**, however, is built on the **Medium Case** \- reflecting our actual expectations around user psychology, early avatar mix, and referral velocity. Both versions support full hiring, narrative ignition, and confidence in user acquisition \- while the Low Case preserves fallback triggers if key metrics underperform.

### **Capital Strategy**

Our capital development is designed to scale with belief. It holds under pressure, unlocks at traction, and never gets ahead of what the users have actually proven. Our Financial Model spreadsheet has all the details, but in short: Evryn is pursuing a **user-led capital strategy**, backed by traditional VC as needed. Early build funds cover foundational work. Angel funds support team formation and user acquisition. Crowdfunding (via StartEngine) is fueled by user belief, not performance marketing \- closing the loop between trust, traction, and growth. Together, these sources ensure a runway wide enough to cover all critical pre-launch execution:

* Justin has bootstrapped $15k  
* An additional $25k has been raised from family  
* We hope to secure an additional $48k from family, to put us in a strong place strategically to talk to angels  
* where we intend to secure at least another $750k (we only need $400k, but we want to build in a contingency that allows for traction to lag, and the $750 guarantees launch)  
* Pre-sales and crowdfunding (discussed in Growth section) provide the rest of the capital we need to make it to launch  
* If our marketing plan works the way we think it will, we won’t need even the minimum $100k from angels, but we want to be in position to secure it anyway, so that we can make it to launch *no matter what*.

As mentioned, users can pre-load funds into their Evryn Wallet. In addition to the reasons given in the UX section, pre-loading funds also gives us working capital to provide services before they’re delivered.

## **L.A. Film Industry Launch (December 28th, 2025\)**

We’re launching initially in Los Angeles, targeting the film industry, for a few reasons:

1. It’s the industry we’ve identified as having the most need for high quality introductions \- everyone is either clamoring for attention they can’t get, or drowning in attention they don’t want. Evryn solves both sides of this equation simultaneously. Everyone finds only their perfect needle in this enormous haystack, and nothing else.  
2. The industry is *highly collaborative* \- no one makes a movie alone \- and it mixes business, creative, social, romantic, and big money \- in a way that no other industry does.  
3. It’s very tight-knit \- each new customer knows 300-5000 prime qualified leads  
4. The current tools for collaboration in film are woefully inadequate \- Facebook threads, job boards, DM chains, referral lists \- it’s all noise. Evryn steps in as a trusted connector: someone who knows you or your project’s rhythm, your creative style, your team’s emotional tone \- and introduces only when there’s real alignment.  
5. Justin’s extensive reach (78,000+ second-gen contacts in the industry) will be the ignition point. Depending on funnel mechanics, Justin's network is projected to be able to bring 1-4k users by launch date \- *before* any other marketing efforts or ad spend.  
6. Justin’s understanding of the structure of the film industry allows us to enter key nodes at just the right time, and rapidly spread into many different branches of the industry at once.  
7. Capturing the film industry in LA opens up:  
   1. The rest of LA \- virtually everyone in LA is connected to the film industry in some way \- not only consumers, vendors and support, but also other full industries, like LA’s music and startup ecosystems  
   2. The rest of the film industry in the country and world \- no one works in film in any major capacity without ties to LA  
   3. Taking over the film industry in other cities won’t create quite the nuclear bomb that it does in LA, but it will be a nice starter pool; we can then spread out into those cities based on their own unique qualities, having built our waiting lists while serving customers in LA.   
   4. The megaphone of the entertainment industry \- once stars, studios and influencers are on Evryn, word will spread like wildfire.

All of this makes the L.A. film industry Evryn’s *ideal* point of ignition.

Rather than a general public launch, **Evryn v0.3 (see Tech section) will soft-launch within this warm circle** \- creative professionals, storytellers, and aligned individuals in Los Angeles who are likely to “get” the vision. 

Among these early users, we’re identifying key cultural catalysts \- users whose presence carries narrative weight. These are the actors whose castmates follow them, the writers whose group chats are industry gospel, the producers who mentor dozens. They don’t just ‘use’ Evryn \- they signal that something new is happening. That’s how the whisper cascade becomes a roar.

These early users will be invited through personal outreach and warm introductions, emphasizing *quality over quantity*. Each invite feels special – because it is. We’ll leverage **existing relationships, alumni networks, community groups, and key connectors** to seed the user base. For example, reaching out to film school cohorts, local meetup organizers, and influential yet under-the-radar connectors in LA ensures our very first users come in through **trusted referrals**, not cold ads.

This isn’t a mass-market play. Evryn launches in waves that start at the “bottom of the food chain” and move upward \- across multiple verticals like acting, production, and creative. In the actor track, for example: actors first, then casting directors, then directors and producers, then institutions. In parallel, Production follows the same structure: crew → coordinators → producers → studios, etc., etc. Each wave is culturally adjacent to the last, but each demands its own kind of resonance.

Hollywood opportunity is far from equally accessible, so we start where the pain is most acute, the need is clearest, *and* our access is the greatest: the bottom. 

We position Evryn as:

“An invite-only platform where you get introduced to people who can change your career \- but only if someone vouches for you.”

This triggers an immediate whisper cascade:

* “Do you know Evryn? Do *you* know Evryn?”  
* “Who can get me an invite?”  
* “I need to get in before the casting directors arrive.”

It frames access to Evryn as **status**, and status as **prelude to serendipity**.

And once we’re *the fastest way to find all the talent,* then we earn our way further and further in by offering the one thing everyone in the industry \- even the gatekeepers \- want: *that perfect needle in that massive haystack* that they’d never have found on their own.

We don’t grow by blitzing. We grow by solving, proving, and being invited forward \- circle by circle.

As we move, **each segment is primed in advance**: actors know Casting Directors are the next we’ll invite; then Casting arrives to find: all the talent is already on. Crew knows Producers are coming next; Producers arrive to find that all the crew is on Evryn. This pacing turns every new group into a gravity well for the next, minimizing CAC and maximizing resonance. The strategy remains tightly focused on the film industry \- not because others won’t join, but because this world is dense, interconnected, and culturally loud. If we capture this city’s creative core, the surrounding networks will follow. Carefully timed invitations, whisper-based access, and early working matches \- not just big wins, but believable ones \- will drive adoption. Once we are the trusted connector in LA film, the rest of the ecosystem becomes accessible on our terms.

*(Note: In the film industry, introductions aren’t enough \- follow-through matters. By facilitating payments and re-engagements, Evryn becomes not just the introducer, but the connective tissue for real working relationships. This is a core differentiator at launch.)*

### **Launch Timeline**

Since we’re launching first in the Los Angeles film industry, we’re timing to optimize industry flows.

* **April, May**: 

  * Justin builds basic conceptual infrastructure  
  * Onboards “General Counsel Lite”  
  * Finalizes budget  
  * Secures first family funds  
* **June**:   
  * Justin starts scouting CTO, BizOps, UX and Growth leads  
  * Starts warming angels  
  * Finalizes incorporation and trademark  
  * Builds Evryn 0.1 \- an alpha prototype that is solely for giving funders and cofounder candidates a taste of what Evryn could be.   
  * Product planning and pitch refinement are underway in parallel.  
* **July**:   
  * Meetings with key hires and angels  
  * Onboarding key hires complete by Aug 1   
  * **8/25/25 Update**: these deadlines have been missed: CTO search has taken much longer than anticipated. No core team in place yet)  
* **Aug**:   
  * Sprint to Evryn 0.3, our “Minimum Lovable Version”, which will have all Evryn capabilities *except* for matchmaking. This model will be for our landing page, where leads will meet Evryn, she’ll collect info about who they are and what they need, wow them with what she can do for them, and then encourage them to share, pre-buy and invest in Evryn via StartEngine.   
  * All growth assets (referral system, landing pages, StartEngine campaign content) are finalized.  
  * Secure Angel funds by end of August, in order to start SE campaign  
  * As soon as Evryn 0.3 goes live on marketing site, SE Campaign quietly goes live in “testing the waters” mode.  
  * **8/25/25 Update**: Due to July delays, much of this has pushed. However, Justin has pivoted to build with contractors, and still believes we can have an MVP live in late September. This will be a slower ramp, but our belief is that the traction of getting this in front of real users will help land core team and angels.)  
* **September-December**:   
  * Anticipation Mode begins \- at a time when film folks have just finished their summer shoots, and are feeling anxious about where their next gig will come from  
  * Justin reaches out to his warm film network  
  * Evryn onboards new users and begins personalized anticipation drip to each user, to have them chomping at the bit to start using Evryn when we launch in January.  
  * Growth lead monitors growth metrics, uses pre-sale revenue and StartEngine investments from each new user who comes on, to fund campaigns to bring in more users.  
  * Tech team is building Evryn 1.0’s matchmaking engine.  
  * Legal is finalizing all documents.  
  * Hiring Freeze November 15th  
  * Functional Requirements by December 1st:  
    * The launch feature set is complete and no new features are introduced. Technical systems should be stable, delivering full matchmaking  
    * The legal structure locked.  
  * December is dedicated to **final QA, polish, security testing, and any pre-launch marketing prep**.  
  * **9/10/25 Update:** Strong CTO candidate being trialed. Comes with his own dev team \- may be able to make up some lost time.  
  * **9/26/25 Update:** UX, Product, and Ops Lead contractors in place. Focusing on 0.3 stable by 10/22 for AFI Fest and Austin Film Festival.   
* **December 28th**: launch in that dead week between Christmas and having to get back to the grind in early January \- the only time busy film folks will have before the film industry hits its hottest time of the year.  
* **Post Launch**: The first six months of our launch is timed to be turbocharged by the most acute industry need:  
  * Sundance in January \- Evryn will be a whisper roar  
  * Pilot Season Jan-Mar: everyone needs to crew up in January, but last-minute replacements will be needed throughout  
  * SXSW as well as Film School & MFA showcases in the spring  
  * And finally, staffing for summer shoots

### **Sacred Launch Conditions**

December 28th is not a tentative launch window or marketing milestone \- it is our operational deadline.

Unless one of the following conditions fails, we go.

1. Must have key team fully onboarded by Aug 1 (see below)  
2. Must have funding in place by end of August  
3. All tech and legal must be fully stable Dec 1  
4. Must have a minimum of 3000 users for network density

### **Launch Roles & Onboarding Timeline**

| Role | Fully Onboard | Rationale |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **CTO (Tech & Infrastructure) 10-14 days of onboarding**  | **By Aug 1 (but ideally earlier)** | Needs to be in place ahead of Angel meetings, needs at least 3.5 months to fully own architecture, AI, and launch stability |
| **Ops & Biz Strategy Lead 7-10 days of onboarding** | **By Aug 1** | Ahead of VC to properly model cash flow, burn model, timelines, and coordination of moving parts |
| **Lead Designer (UX \+ Product Hybrid) 7-10 days of onboarding** | **By Aug 1** | At least 1 mo before public outreach; needs 3 mo to own flows, onboarding, and emotional design |
| **Growth Manager (Referral \+ StartEngine) 7-14 days of onboarding** | **By Aug 1** | At least 1 mo before big ad spend; UA assets, referral system, and traction narrative must be prepped early |
| **Legal Support (Virtual GC \+ Lite GC) 1-2 days of onboarding per event** | **Full GC by Sep 1** | Use Clerky for easy stuff, Andy and the Fenwick team for harder stuff. |

Each of these roles has specific onboarding timeline dependencies. The **Tech and UX leads** should ideally join at the same time to work hand-in-hand on the product (both by August 1st). The **Growth lead** can join slightly later if needed, but earlier is better to shape the campaign strategy. **Legal support** is ongoing; our fractional legal advisors are already in place, and by launch we may convert this to a more formal role depending on workload.

Crucially, some hires are **conditional on hitting funding milestones**: for example, scaling the Growth team or bringing on additional engineers under the Tech lead will depend on the success of the StartEngine raise and early revenue. We have identified which roles are must-have versus nice-to-have at launch. 

**Must-haves (even if fractional/part-time):** Tech leadership, BizOps, UX/design input, and basic legal oversight – these are non-negotiable for a safe and solid launch. 

**Nice-to-haves (if budget allows):** a full-time Growth marketing manager and a full-time General Counsel can be deferred until we have revenue or additional capital post-launch. By structuring the team this way, we maintain operational readiness for launch without overextending our budget.

Until funding lands and full-time hires are secured, Evryn Inc. runs as a **flat org**: all leads report directly to the CEO.

But functional clusters already exist:

* **Product \+ Tech**: meet jointly for execution rhythm  
* **Growth \+ Campaigns**: aligned on StartEngine timeline  
* **BizOps \+ Legal**: structurally integrated

As new hires come online, these clusters will evolve into formal management layers.

* **CTO / Tech Lead** → owns infrastructure, hiring, and QA  
* **UX Lead / CPO** → owns onboarding, conversation flow, match UI  
* **BizOps Lead** → owns runway, model, legal coordination, and hiring  
* **Growth Lead** → owns StartEngine execution and narrative virality

### **Department Overviews – March of ‘25 → March of ‘26**

Each of these sections provides a high-resolution snapshot of what each department handles, what it’s responsible for in the **first 6 months**, and what it will likely take on in the **second 6 months**. These overviews are specific to Evryn’s current model, product type, and strategic roadmap, with urgency driven by our accelerated launch timeline (August 2025\) and the expectation of aggressive copycat competition once we hit visibility.

### **Scope Management & Expansion Triggers**

If traction or capital drops us below key viability thresholds, we enact immediate scope compression to protect launch integrity and operational trust.

These are not launch-stoppers. They are **scope triggers** \- designed to protect the integrity of the user experience, the campaign, and the team.

These triggers don’t cancel launch.

They reshape it.

We track them in real-time using the Financial Model (Low Case).

**Triggers include:**

* Projected runway falls below 3.5 months through Q4  
* Compute costs significantly higher than expected  
* Cumulative user count lags behind break-even thresholds by October  
* StartEngine performance falls below modeled CAC-adjusted ROI

If any of these are hit, we adjust accordingly, reducing ad spend, pausing nonessential hires or contractors, and prioritizing trust maintenance over scale.

Conversely, if traction outperforms the Medium Case, we expand scope:

* Accelerate hiring of post-launch roles  
* Reinvest selectively in StartEngine campaigns \- until CAC begins to rise and organic ROI flattens  
* Expand into additional match types and higher-value avatar tiers  
* Enable deeper trust memory and emotional calibration in early interactions

The launch plan flexes with reality. But the core? The experience of meeting Evryn \- that never gets compromised.

---

### **Technical Milestones & Build Cadence**

Evryn is not launching all at once. She’s rolling out in stages \- each one designed to layer trust, intelligence, and stability into the system before users ever feel the weight of complexity.

This is a staged ignition plan:

**Evryn 0.1 – June 2025 (Founder Alpha)**

* Lightweight prompt-chained demo built directly by the CEO  
* Designed to prove Evryn’s tone, intuition, and voice  
* Used for early investor conversations, team recruiting, and partner trust-building  
* Not connected to backend or CRM \- pure emotional resonance layer

**Evryn 0.3 – Late September 2025**

* Live onboarding experience (conversational AI)  
* Privacy gating  
* CRM capture \+ tagging  
* Share button  
* Early learning and resonance calibration  
* System logging for tone and refusal QA  
* Lightweight admin dashboard  
* No user-to-user matchmaking yet

**Evryn 0.3.1 – Early October 2025**

* Adding in purchase and investment functionality

**Evryn 0.4 – Late Oct-Dec 2025**

* While our official line will continue to be that we won’t have matches until 12/28, we will quietly begin doing human-in-the-loop Wizard of Oz MVP matchmaking to have the opportunity to deliver surprise delight to users, train the model, start to bring in a small trickle of early revenue, and show traction to potential strategic partners.  
* For these early matches, we’ll ask users if they’d be willing to help us test, then we’d offer two potential matches for each match, to help us learn faster.

**Evryn 1.0 – December 2025 (Launch)**

* Full matchmaking engine (RBM \+ HLM)  
* Intro flows with double opt-in \+ safety wrap  
* Queue logic \+ pacing filters  
* Basic emotional memory  
* QA panel \+ admin tooling

We freeze feature scope by **December 1**.

We launch with **1.0 locked and stable** on December 28\.

## Where We Are Now (10/1/25)

* We’ve locked The Core Team:  
  * **CEO**: Justin McGowan  
  * **Operations Lead**: Andrew Lester  
  * **Chief Technical Officer** \- in trial build: Yosuke Kuroki  
  * **Technical Product Manager**: Salil Chatrath  
  * **User Experience Designer**: Manuele Capacci  
  * **General Counsel**: Andy Albertson and the extended team at Fenwick & West\*   
  * Growth Lead will be pursued soon.  
* **Internal MVP Validation, Preparing for External Pilot:** We’ve already built *Evryn 0.1* \- a working conversational prototype that **gets to know you, guides onboarding, captures structured profiles and contact info, and even runs willingness-to-pay experiments.** She asks open-ended questions, follows up to uncover real needs, and holds the trust frame throughout.   
* Justin tested 0.1 rigorously to refine the conversational flow, but now with the arrival of Tech and UX, we’re **now in the process of rebuilding this into *Evryn 0.3***, which will be put in front of a **small curated set of real users**. 0.3 will not have matchmaking, but will set us up for 0.4, which intentionally blends live functionality with limited human-in-the-loop “Wizard-of-Oz” scaffolding, allowing us to validate in-market while keeping burn lean and sequencing toward a polished, **scalable** *Evryn 1.0* and beyond.

\*More than just a very prestigious law firm, Fenwick is a strategic partner, whose willingness to take us on as a client not only raises our profile, but decreases our short-term burn rate (due to legal cost deferment), and increases our access to Fenwick’s strategic and capital partners.

# **Growth**

## **Growth Ethos**

Even starting as early as our pre-launch growth, we’re making sure our incentives are always aligned with user success. As opposed to starting primarily with a broad marketing push, we’re personally inviting key users in, and building everything from there. We’re only interested in aligned growth: growth that doesn’t further our ethos and mission is growth that hurts us in the long term. Instead, we seek to build a **flywheel of trust** – a compounding effect where trust leads to growth, which creates more trust. By fostering a sense of **belonging and co-ownership**, we turn users into evangelists. And then we scale sustainably, but expanding trust: **rhizomatic growth** – like the roots of a great tree, spreading strong and unseen until suddenly the canopy is everywhere. We want every early user to feel like **a co-founder of a mission-driven community**. As Evryn will say, *“Users aren’t leads… They’re co-founders of a new future \- a human system built on trust”*.

## **Messaging**

**Brand Storytelling**: we’re positioning this as something far bigger than a new matchmaking app \- this is a cultural movement toward more authentic communication, and a way to get rid of the noise and frustration you’ve come to expect from other platforms, and instead connect with who you really want to connect with.

**Defining Evryn:** To help users, press, and investors understand her, we’ve developed a few clear “category corrections” \- short one-liners that clarify what she *isn’t*, and what she *is*:

* “Not a dating app. A resonance layer for life.”  
* “Not a chatbot. A relational intelligence with judgment.”  
* “Not another network. A trust-based connection engine.”  
* “Not a marketplace. A personal connector for what \- and who \- you actually need.”

By naming her role clearly \- and rejecting the mental shortcuts people will try to apply \- we establish Evryn as the origin point of a new category. 

**Evryn and users will be our main spokespeople**

* In marketing, we’ll focus on user experiences.  
* When people land on our site, they’ll talk to Evryn. She has high-level training in ethical, value-based sales techniques, which she uses to make sure that she’s capturing the attention of prospects when they come to learn about her. But she doesn’t use pushy or tricky techniques \- she just makes sure that she is clearly demonstrating **value**, and getting the “close” (in this case, contact info, shares, pre-sales, and investment).  
* Since Evryn will get to know each and every user rather personally, **we have an always-on channel where they can voice their dreams and concerns, and see that she’s listening, and taking them seriously.** She can check in with them, see what’s working, what’s not, and for those who are very happy, she can see if they would like to share \- personally, or be featured in our marketing.

**Evangelist Story Loops**

When a user has a life-changing experience, Evryn doesn’t just celebrate quietly \- she may ask, gently:

“Would you want to help others by sharing your story?”

If the user says yes, Evryn can help shape the moment into something others can feel \- through short video clips, guided reflections, or social narratives that retain the honesty of the original experience.

These stories may appear:

* On the user’s own channels (if they choose)  
* On Evryn’s public-facing platforms  
* Or woven into onboarding flows, match prompts, or trust-building moments

Spend is focused on the most resonant, human stories \- not polished campaigns. The goal is to let real users show what’s possible \- without forcing anything.

This creates a quiet flywheel: Stories → Trust → Users → More stories.

And because it all flows from relationships \- not performance \- we avoid the traps of gamified storytelling or ideological oversimplification.

Every story we share must reflect Evryn’s tone:  
 *Personal. Humane. Nuanced. Emotionally Honest.*

**Key messaging themes on all channels:** We will consistently hit a few powerful themes in all our storytelling:

1. **The old way is broken:**  
   1. **dating apps** rely on an addictive-but-soul-crushing dynamic of swiping, where you are either ignored or spammed, they incentivize superficial engagement, string you along with subscriptions instead of delivering value, and degrade trust through ghosting, misalignment, and gamified mechanics.  
   2. **professional networks** prioritize broadcasting and inbound noise. Users are either ignored or spammed, and context is absent. There’s no signal for readiness, alignment, or intent  
   3. **gig platforms** reduce people to availability and task-type \- commoditizing talent, eroding trust, and encouraging transactional thinking. Whether it’s creative work or a ride across town, the relationship ends with the receipt.  
   4. **social media platforms** promise connection, but optimize for time on the app, make everyone perform for the feed, make everyone else’s life look better than yours \- or even theirs, really \- is, and are known to increase feelings of depression and disconnection.  
   5. **the film industry**’s current approach is just chaos \- Facebook threads, job boards, DM chains, referral lists \- it’s all noise.  
2. **Resonance over resemblance** – Evryn finds deeper human matches, not superficial ones, solving the loneliness and disconnection caused by modern life, and *exacerbated* by existing social platforms.  
3. **Users as owners** – Evryn is literally and philosophically *owned by the users*, not by Big Tech or VC overlords, meaning her incentives stay aligned with users.  
4. **Trust and care** – We’d rather grow slowly with trust than rapidly with gimmicks. Evryn is patient, human-centric, and here to *earn* her users.  
5. **A relationship, not an app** – Using Evryn feels like interacting with a wise friend or guide, not a piece of software.  
6. **Share freely. She’ll sort the signal** – You don’t have to figure out who to trust \- that’s Evryn’s job. Evryn is built to protect what’s sacred. You don’t have to screen every invite like it’s a background check. Just share it with the people who you think might benefit \- and let her handle the rest. She connects people based on how much she trusts them. No one gets in just because they were invited. That’s what keeps the experience beautiful.

**Training Mode Messaging: Setting Expectations While Building Belief:** 

Anticipation Mode isn’t just a gap between onboarding and matches \- it’s an active, emotionally resonant phase where belief deepens, curiosity compounds, and users start to *feel* like something important is taking shape. From a growth perspective, this is one of our greatest opportunities: when users are most hopeful, most curious, and most open to helping build what they believe in.

In Evryn’s earliest days, she makes it clear that she’s still learning \- and that users have a choice: Do you want to wait for perfection…or help shape it?

Evryn will say something like:

*“I’m still learning \- and honestly, I might not get it exactly right at first. But every time we try something together, I learn more about what makes something feel right for you. And I’m building my understanding just for you. That means over time, I get better and better \- faster, sharper, more intuitive. So if you’re willing to be part of that learning arc, I’d be honored. We’re building the future of human connection together. But if not, no pressure \- it just might take me longer to find someone who feels exactly right.”*

This approach frames users as co-creators, not testers \- and it sets expectations for Evryn’s early match performance while anchoring long-term value.

And because users are emotionally invested \- but not yet matched \- they’re especially receptive to invitations that feel like co-creation: sharing Evryn, pre-buying credits, or even investing. When belief is high but delivery hasn’t landed yet, the impulse to help build *what they want to receive* becomes powerful.

All of this is paired with a generous trust-first policy:  
 *“You never pay until you’re genuinely happy. So even if this connections’s just okay, you risk nothing \- but I learn so much about how to make the next one better.”*

This early humility doesn’t reduce belief \- it reinforces it. And it allows Evryn to gather high-quality feedback and behavioral signals, while building a core user base that knows they’re not just consumers \- they’re helping build the future of human connection.

## **Outreach**

We’ll first employ a **“slow burn” strategy** that aligns with our organic growth.

We’ll start with Justin’s warm network, elicit referrals via a share button, but also by telling people how much better it works to share personally \- this only works if a bunch of people come on board.

We then do:

* **PR Strategy**:

  * **targeted outreach to niche outlets and communities**: think tech writers who cover social innovation, local LA press that might find “Hollywood connector AI” interesting, or podcasts on relationships and community-building. Initial press coverage doesn’t need to be mass-market; it needs to *recruit believers*.  
  * Our press narrative will highlight things like **“AI who finds you “your people” \- that’s owned by its users”**, **“founder turns to community ahead of VCs to launch a complete reinvention of what it means to be a social network”**, and **“the anti-Tinder: an AI that finds your soul connections”**. These hooks differentiate us and underscore the movement ethos.  
  * As traction builds, we have **press “trigger points” planned**. When we hit certain milestones, we’ll escalate to larger media outlets with the proof points in hand. Also, **success on the crowdfunding front (number of investors or funds raised from the crowd) can be newsworthy** later in the process, reinforcing that our users quite literally back us. The key is that any broad press outreach will be timed to *validate* momentum rather than trying to create it from scratch. This way, press hits pour fuel on a fire that’s already lit, rather than a spark in the void.

* **Community outreach**:

  * film festivals  
    * passing out fliers, or even setting up a table or hosting a mixer at Austin, Sundance, SXSW (ideally, we’d have hand-selected early users evangelizing at festivals)  
    * writing a guest post about “The future of finding your film crew”  
  * film school networks  
  * niche industry sites like NoFilmSchool, gear forums, etc.  
  * **forums**: by spending a few days posting and engaging in targeted forums and groups (Reddit, Facebook, Discord, X), our small team can generate thousands of impressions  
  * Transparent updates (“Here’s what we learned from our first 100 connections” or “Why we’re letting users invest $1 in us”) will not only engage users but can catch the eye of journalists or influencers who follow authentic startup stories. We’ll highlight user stories (with permission), celebrate small wins, and even openly discuss challenges or how user feedback is shaping Evryn. This authenticity feeds our brand: people see that Evryn is being built in partnership with its community. Over time, this can cultivate a **tribe of followers** eager to support and amplify our message

* **Influencer outreach:**

  * Influencers will be identified within the film community to amplify our message.

* **Ad spend**

  * We’ll focus on **highly targeted, story-driven ads** – likely on social platforms and search, focusing on people in the L.A. film world. We’ll leverage testimonials or press quotes as soon as we have them, to add credibility. Also, because Evryn’s concept is novel, **video ads or short animations** explaining “How Evryn works” could perform well. We may also explore **paid partnerships**, such as sponsoring niche newsletters or YouTube videos. These aren’t pure ads but can drive qualified traffic.  
  * If initial paid experiments show a CAC that’s acceptable, we will scale incrementally.  
  * We’re budgeting for an aggressive ad spend campaign, but our hope is that these other efforts bear enough fruit that we can under-spend on ads.

## **Referral, Pre-Sales, and Investment as Growth Drivers**

As mentioned earlier, we’ll do pre-sales and investment. This is for capital, but it’s also because users with skin in the game become die-hard champions. (we will not have dedicated StartEngine campaign \- SE will just be where users go to invest after Evryn tells them that that’s an option:

“We don’t want to be dependent on institutional money – we’re starting with you, the users. If we’re going to build something truly different, it has to begin with the people it’s for.

Evryn is yours.

If you believe in what Evryn is doing \- if you’ve felt what she can do \- or even just if you can imagine the world she’ll create \- you can help bring her to more people.

You can help build the future of human connection.

And when that future arrives, you’re not just someone who watched it happen.

**You’re someone who helped make it real.**

or

*“Imagine owning a slice of the company that replaces all of the broken ways that people try to connect… You don’t need a thousand dollars; you just need to believe in what we’re building.”*

This appeals to the sense of **participation and rebellion** against big tech monopolies.

We’ll let users know that while we will seek traditional funding if we need to, our hope is that Evryn is primarily owned by users. But for that to happen, we need them to join us.

We will **seed the StartEngine campaign with around $50K from friendly sources (family, close angels) to provide social proof**. So when a user checks it out, they’ll see others have invested and that it’s a credible opportunity. However, we *intentionally avoid blasting this campaign publicly in the early phase*. Why? Because a slow trickle of investments from a small user base could look like “failure” in the public eye if misunderstood. By **keeping it within the family of users, we control the narrative**.

#### **Why investment and pre-sales matter to GTM:** 

Early capital and revenue via pre-sales does more than help cash flow; it **validates demand**. If users are willing to pay upfront, even at a discount, it strongly signals product-market fit.

Once our user traction is undeniable, we can consider reaching out to traditional investors if we need, but now from a place of strength and leverage \- a place where we can make good on our promise to keep our first loyalty with users. If all goes well, our users’ investments could carry us significantly, reducing how much we ever need from traditional VCs or at least proving demand and valuation in negotiations.

#### **Referrals:**  {#referrals:}

Evryn’s referral system rewards trust with value. Before launch, Evryn hasn’t earned your trust yet \- so if you refer someone who becomes a paying customer, Evryn rewards your trust by adding Evryn Credit to your wallet that you can use toward future connections. This lets early users help grow the network while building real credit they can see and use. After launch, we want sharing to *only* reflect belief in the product, not incentives. 

Credit only unlocks once the referred user completes their first paid connection, ensuring that rewards are tied to real engagement. There’s no cap on what great referrers can earn, and all rewards are transparently tracked.

## **Segment Alignment – From Research to Activation**

Evryn’s Avatar system (see the Financial Model) is modeled directly from observed user pain. Each core segment identified in our deep research maps onto one or more of our Avatars. It informs everything from CAC to referral lift to match volume per persona.

This table summarizes how the research layers into the major pathways of the growth funnel:

| Market Segment (DR Report) | Evryn Financial Model Avatars | Strategic Role in GTM |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Film Creators & Crews** | Builders, Operators, Seekers, Legacy Gatekeepers | Our ignition point. High-trust, high-stakes matches in a tightly-networked industry. The entry wedge and the signal boost. |
| **Disillusioned Daters** | Seekers, Casual Connectors, Social Anchors, Torchbearers | Emotionally resonant, high ARPU, naturally viral. These users evangelize when they feel seen. |
| **Network-Burnout Professionals** | Operators, Builders | Mid-funnel utility users. They anchor credibility, respond well to value-first intros, and drive monetization through trust. |
| **Creative Collaborators** | Builders, Operators, Casual Connectors, Social Anchors | CAC-efficient cohort. They retain when matched well and often escalate into repeat interactions. |
| **Gig-Weary Seekers** (Uber/Fiverr disillusionment) | Operators | Emerging layer. Their expectations are shaped by speed and availability \- but Evryn can surprise them with consistency and trust. Over time, they build “personal clouds” of go-tos. |

These mappings drive how we model activation, referral velocity, match density, and messaging tone. For example:

* **Seekers** are emotionally primed. They’re looking for meaning, belonging, not just utility. Win their heart, and you win their loyalty.  
* **Casual Connectors** thrive on usefulness and simplicity. They convert best when the value is immediate and the ask is minimal \- ideal for low-friction viral mechanics.  
* **Builders** need trust scaffolding and long-term potential.  
* **Operators** need reliability, speed, and frictionless delivery.  
* **Social Anchors** engage around belonging. They don't chase novelty \- but when they believe in something, they bring their community with them.  
* **Torchbearers** need to feel chosen, then become firestarters.  
* **Legacy Gatekeepers** must be invited at exactly the right moment \- with the right kind of social proof already in motion.  
* **And the rest?** They’re the *very* long tail. Institutions, niche personalities, quiet lurkers, outliers who don’t refer or evangelize \- but who stay. They’re the ones Evryn quietly keeps earning, match by match. They don’t drive spikes, but they build the floor. And over time, they make us undeniable.

We’re not building generalized funnels. We’re building **precision-targeted belief ladders**, calibrated to the jobs these users actually hired their current platforms to do \- and were let down by.

*For a much deeper dive, see the [Deep Research Report: Market Analysis & Competitive Landscape](https://www.notion.so/DR-Report-Market-Analysis-Competitive-Landscape-1e2a5052be0380d4a6c8fbaed95899e3?pvs=21).*

## **Network Density & Ignition Model**

Evryn works when she can make introductions that feel inevitable \- like “of course I needed to meet this person.”

And while that kind of resonance depends on Evryn being a skilled matchmaker, it simply can’t function without **network density**.

Not just *more users* \- but the **right people**, in the **right clusters**, with enough **mutual relevance** for meaningful connections to emerge.

And unlike a traditional app, Evryn doesn’t operate in silos like “just dating” or “just professional networking.” She connects across contexts: romantic, creative, practical, professional.

So what we need isn’t just users \- we need **connected ecosystems** \- pools of verified, richly-understood users who naturally interact *with each other* in high-trust ways.

### **What That Looks Like**

Take our first wedge: actors in the Los Angeles film industry.

An actor might need:

* A casting director  
* An agent  
* A manager  
* A director  
* A coach  
* A photographer  
* A date  
* A roommate

Any one of those could be a resonant match \- and all of them come from **different roles** \- but they’re all part of the same **relational ecosystem**.

To serve users in that world, Evryn needs to *understand and represent that whole cluster*, not just one slice of it.

So we don’t just need “500 actors.” We need a **network** where *actors \+ collaborators \+ connectors \+ supporters* are all represented, **in enough density** that Evryn can find fit.

And yes, people from outside the film world will show up organically. But we are **only building for people who touch the industry**. That’s our job in this phase. Everything else is noise.

#### **So What Do We Actually Need?**

To make high-quality, high-trust introductions in the L.A. film ecosystem, we need:

* **\~500 verified, richly profiled users**  
  * Across diverse roles inside the industry  
  * With a variety of intents (romantic, creative, logistical, etc.)  
  * Sharing cultural and geographic overlap so introductions feel natural  
  * Enough coverage that **Evryn doesn’t stall or misfire**

That’s the threshold where Evryn starts delivering matches that feel truly resonant \- not just technically valid.

### **What are the Resonance Thresholds?**

Match quality isn’t binary \- it improves as user density and signal quality increase.

But here’s what we model:

* **With \~150 users:** Evryn can start testing matches, but fit is inconsistent. Most users won’t get a meaningful connection yet.  
* **At \~300 users:** Early “magic moments” begin \- maybe 10–15% of users get something that feels amazing. Trust loop is fragile.  
* **At \~500 users (diverse roles \+ intents):** Resonant matches become common. 35–50% of active users experience matches they’d happily refer others based on.  
* **Beyond 800:** Saturation effects kick in. Multi-intent matches (e.g., creative \+ romantic) become possible. Match quality improves faster than growth rate.

At 500+, we start getting:

* Reliable early matches  
* Feedback loops to train the model  
* A working trust graph  
* The emotional resonance that drives belief, sharing, and momentum

### **Sub-Cluster Ignition**

Evryn doesn’t need the entire ecosystem to be dense before she works. Resonance can begin as soon as specific role-pairs or sub-clusters reach viable density. For example, if enough actors and directors are present, Evryn can generate strong matches in that slice—even if other pairs (like producers ↔ DPs) aren’t yet viable. Each sub-cluster that reaches threshold not only delivers value on its own, but also acts as a magnet for adjacent roles, accelerating overall ecosystem density.

### **Market Size & Penetration**

We are not for everyone. We’re for the right ones. Our trust gates shrink the top of funnel and strengthen the graph. That’s the point.

**Timeframe:** All figures below are **annualized at steady state** (mature market). “SOM” is **annual paying penetration** of the trusted pool (TSM).

**Total Addressable Market (TAM)** \- Everyone who could ever benefit from Evryn‑style, high‑trust introductions across life contexts (global in scope). TAM is intentionally left at the conceptual level; our operating plans target concrete **SAM**s below.

**Serviceable Available Market (SAM)** \- The geographies and ecosystems we actively target (e.g., L.A. film; then additional city clusters in the U.S. and internationally) within the next 3–5 years.

**Trusted Serviceable Market (TSM)** \- Our SAM after identity and behavior filters. Some people simply aren’t connectable here. We model **\~60–70%** of SAM as trust‑eligible, **\~15–20%** soft‑limited to low‑stakes, **\~8–12%** hard‑excluded.

**Serviceable Obtainable Market per year (SOM/yr)** \- Because engagement is baked into monthly matches across many life contexts, **there is no separate “active‑need” haircut**. Annual paying penetration varies by market maturity:

* **Igniting / early dense:** **35–55% of TSM per year**  
* **Maturing:** **55–75% of TSM per year**  
* **Dense & multi‑context (steady state):** **70–90% of TSM per year**  
* **Upper bound (select flagship metros):** up to **\~85–95%** when avatar mix and density match our model. 

**Design principle:** Filters shrink TAM, but strengthen LTV and cross‑context recurrence. 

---

### **Operating assumptions (annualized)**

* **Price & frequency (blended across business \+ consumer classes):** 6 successful matches per month per paying user × $8 per match × 12 months \= $576 ARPU/year.  
* **Matchability (within TSM, by domain):** Buy‑Nothing 85–90% · Film 75–85% at density · Dating 55–70% · Cofounders 25–40%.  
* **Density thresholds (L.A. film wedge):** Resonance becomes common **\~500 verified, diverse users**; multi‑intent lift **\>800**.

---

### **Example calculations (annual, steady state)**

| Scenario | SAM | TSM  (60–70% of SAM) | SOM/yr (annual payers) | Revenue @ $576 ARPU |
| ----- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **L.A. Film Ecosystem** | 200,000 | 120,000– 140,000 | 84,000– 126,000 | $48.4M– $72.6M |
| **Multi‑City Creative Cluster (first 10 cities)** | 2,000,000 | 1,200,000– 1,400,000 | 660,000– 1,050,000 | $380.2M– $604.8M |
| **U.S. Wide (longer‑horizon, cross‑context)** | 40,000,000 | 24,000,000– 28,000,000 | 13,200,000– 21,000,000 | $7.6B– $12.1B |
| **Global First‑Wave Metros (50–75 cities)** | 200,000,000 | 120,000,000– 140,000,000 | 66,000,000– 126,000,000 | $38.0B– $72.6B |

**Note**: All figures are rounded, order‑of‑magnitude models to guide build and capital planning. Revenues scale approximately linearly with city count at comparable density/mix; domain matchability percentages bound how and where we introduce.

### **When the Magic Starts**

Our Low Case in the Financial Model projects 9,000 verified users on launch day \- all connected to the L.A. film industry, so Evryn launches into a dense, high-signal environment. That means she doesn’t need to warm up from scratch. She can start delivering real value nearly immediately.

With those numbers, our modeling indicates that here’s how it plays out:

* **Day 1–2**: 15–20% of users get matches that feel “shockingly right.” These are high-signal fits \- low-hanging fruit found through basic matching logic.  
* **Day 3–7**: Feedback from early matches tunes the model. 30-60% of users will see their first successful match \- something they’d gladly refer others based on.  
* **Day 8–14**: 70–90% of active users experience a match that feels meaningful, resonant, or genuinely exciting.

We model an average of four “not quite” attempts before something lands. That’s built into the experience. And the messaging: they’re not being sold or strung along \- they’re helping Evryn build the system that will change their life \- and the world. And they don’t pay until it *does* click.

Each early refusal is treated as a gift \- feedback that helps Evryn sharpen her sense of fit. As long as matches feel plausible, not random, belief stays intact \- and Evryn gets better \- fast.

Magical matches start on Day 1\.

But by the end of Week 2, they’re not just possible \- they’re **predictable**.

**Why this is credible:**  
With 9,000 aligned users and most open to multiple kinds of connection, Evryn will make between **27,000 and 40,000 match attempts** in the first two weeks. Each interaction \- match or refusal \- feeds her understanding of fit, tone, and timing. That’s why we expect **70–90% of active users** to receive at least one resonant match by Day 14\. This isn’t theoretical. It’s trained, compounding intelligence \- powered by real-world behavior at scale.

### **Why It Matters**

If we get this right:

* Users get matched across *real-life* needs, not arbitrary categories  
* Evryn starts feeling magical \- and users tell others  
* Match quality improves exponentially as trust compounds

If we don’t:

* Matches feel thin or mismatched  
* Trust breaks  
* Growth stalls before belief takes root

Evryn doesn’t need a million users. She needs one dense, **well-connected industry** \- starting with L.A. film \- where real trust, shared context, and multi-intent resonance can take root.

That’s how we ignite.

## **Other Growth Details**

**Expansion to New Cities:** Once operational readiness supports it \- including sufficient revenue, infrastructure, team bandwidth, and trust system maturity \- we’ll begin expanding to new cities. Each city will likely have a launch countdown, triggered by reaching network density thresholds within **specific connection tags**. Just as a hypothetical example, for an actor in LA: when we have 10 casting directors and 1000 actors, we can go live for actors.

**First Match:** we had initially thought to have the first match free, but this was deprecated when we added Trust-Based Pricing with 100% money-back guarantee. So instead of having to earn user trust on the *first* match, we commit to earning trust on *every* match. 

**Viral content and social proof:** In addition to the sharing and referrals already discussed, we’re engineering **“share-worthy moments”** into the user journey to fuel organic virality. For example, the moment Evryn introduces two people for the first time should feel magical – the kind of experience you *want* to talk about. Because Evryn will know each user personally, she’ll always have the pulse of this, and she can encourage users to celebrate these matches themselves, or to let us share them – either openly or via anonymized stories or testimonials. Early on, even one **breakout story or influencer mention** can kick the engine into high gear. We will be on the lookout for an opportunity – e.g. a local LA influencer who has a great experience and tweets about it, or a mini-viral story like “Evryn found me a co-founder in 24 hours” – and be ready to amplify it. Our team will engage on social media and with press to circulate these early wins (more in Brand Storytelling below).

**Maintaining momentum through generations:** A known challenge in viral growth is potential decay as you move outward – your first cohort might be enthusiastic, but by the 4th or 5th generation of shares, interest can cool. We plan to mitigate this by **ensuring each referred user gets the same warm welcome and context** as the referrer did. Evryn’s narrative to new sign-ups (the way she introduces herself and her mission) will remain consistent and inspiring, so even someone hearing about it fifth-hand understands the vision they’re joining, and feels like it’s first-hand, once they meet Evryn. Additionally, by focusing our initial growth in a specific community (LA film), even referrals outwards often loop within overlapping networks, helping sustain interest. The **goal is a chain reaction that doesn’t sputter out due to lack of context or poor experience**. If we see referral rates dipping by “generation,” we’ll analyze why – perhaps we need fresh content, more social proof, or a nudge for mid-stage users. But our expectation is that **by anchoring on personal connection, meaning, and results (not gimmicks), each new user will feel compelled to share as much as the person who invited them**.

### **Film & Entertainment**

**Current State:** Fragmented, trust-starved, gatekept. No dominant connector.

**Top Competitors:** Facebook Groups, Stage32, StaffMeUp, LinkedIn (potential pivot).

**Evryn’s Edge:** First to unify creative matchmaking under an AI trust model.

* **Strengths (Us):** Emotional intelligence, opt-in intros, creative *and* personal alignment, Justin’s network.  
* **Weaknesses (Us):** Must prove AI isn’t generic. Reputation risk if intros feel off.  
* **Threats:** LinkedIn targeting creatives, Stage32 scaling suddenly, cultural pushback from gatekeepers.  
* **Opportunities:** Win LA film trust early, expand to adjacent creator ecosystems (music, game dev, fashion), as well as the rest of LA, which is intertwined with film.

---

### **Dating Apps**

**Current State:** Massive, churn-heavy, emotionally exhausted.

**Top Competitors:** Tinder, Hinge, Bumble.

**Evryn’s Edge:** No manipulation and misaligned incentives. No profiles. No swipes. Just real introductions that land.

* **Strengths (Us):** No public exposure. Trust-first tech. Concierge model. Outcome focused.  
* **Weaknesses (Us):** Tiny compared to incumbents. Must earn belief early.  
* **Threats:** Bumble pivoting deeper into AI, Hinge copying outcome narrative.  
* **Opportunities:** Users are already burnt out. They want what we offer \- they just don’t know it exists yet.

---

### **Professional Networking**

**Current State:** Static, self-promotional, cold.

**Top Competitors:** LinkedIn, Lunchclub, Bumble Bizz.

**Evryn’s Edge:** Actual introductions. Double-opt-in. Human-centric AI.

* **Strengths (Us):** No spam. No chasing. Multidimensional alignment. Personalized and contextual connections.  
* **Weaknesses (Us):** Will be asked “why not just use LinkedIn?” until we’ve earned visibility.  
* **Threats:** LinkedIn builds real AI matchmaking. Salesforce or Notion enters the space.  
* **Opportunities:** Young pros, creatives, and disillusioned freelancers are already looking for something quieter.

---

### **Gig & Freelance Marketplaces**

**Current State:** Transactional, noisy, commoditized.

**Top Competitors:** Upwork, Fiverr, Uber, Doordash.

**Evryn’s Edge:** From strangers to go-tos. Match once, come back forever.

* **Strengths (Us):** Long-term trust loops. Multidimensional alignment. Cross-purpose intros.  
* **Weaknesses (Us):** Not a transactional tool. Doesn’t make sense to users yet.  
* **Threats:** Upwork layering in AI. Uber scaling personalization.  
* **Opportunities:** Users are already frustrated with randomness. “Personal cloud” model feels futuristic, but real.

### **Social Media & Community Platforms**

**Current State:** Massive, open, chaotic. Not built for connection, but used for it anyway.

**Top Competitors:** Facebook (Groups, Messenger), Instagram (DMs), Discord (servers), Reddit (DMs).

**Evryn’s Edge:** Quiet. Curated. Personal. You don’t scroll \- you get introduced.

* **Strengths (Us):** Zero noise. No virality. Evryn is private by design.  
* **Weaknesses (Us):** We can’t grow through visibility hacks. No instant distribution.  
* **Threats:** Meta releases a “Connections AI.” Discord layers matchmaking into interest servers.  
* **Opportunities:** Billions use social tools for the *wrong job*. We offer the right tool \- and a clear alternative to algorithmic entropy.

---

### **Infrastructure Play: If They Come for Us, *Maybe* We Give Them a Lane**

One risk we’ve considered: if Evryn works, the platforms we disrupt might try to neutralize us. But if the architecture allows it, so does the strategy.

Our long game includes the option to license Evryn’s matchmaking layer \- letting aligned platforms embed her logic, not her soul. For instance:

*“LinkedIn \- now with Evryn intros.”*

This isn’t our goal today. But we’re designing toward the option. If a competitor comes knocking, we want the ability to say yes \- **but only on our terms**.

Why it matters:

* **Strategic judo**: Turn competition into distribution  
* **Redundancy of scale**: Growth isn’t bottlenecked by our user acquisition  
* **Defensive moat**: We become the connective tissue others *need*, to stay competitive

Technically, we’re building toward:

* API-ready trust layers  
* Modular matchmaking and reasoning  
* Privacy-safe integration paths

The default is still a beautiful, centralized product. But the system leaves space for a Trojan horse strategy \- Evryn, inside the walls.

---

# **Technical Architecture**

## **What the System Must Deliver**

Evryn’s tech doesn’t just power a product \- it enables a relationship. To make that relationship feel genuine, safe, and worth returning to, the system must deliver:

* **Trusted Intelligence** – Evryn must understand you quickly, speak with emotional precision, and protect your privacy by design. She needs to interpret nuance, honor consent, and align her guidance with your values \- consistently.  
* **Attuned Presence** – Evryn must feel like she’s *with* you \- tracking your journey, remembering what matters, and knowing when to engage or hold space. Not always active, but always aware.  
* **Resonant Matching** – She must introduce you to people who feel uniquely right \- and worth paying for. That means deep understanding, real constraint handling, and judgment calls that earn belief.  
* **Continuous Learning** – She must improve with every conversation, every match, every outcome. Her model of you \- and what works for you \- should get sharper over time.  
* **Structural Safety** – She must protect users from harm, deception, and noise \- filtering out what doesn’t belong and maintaining a space where trust compounds.

Everything that follows \- our matchmaking layers, trust graph, conversational AI, and system architecture \- is in service of these five imperatives.

## **Core Technical Dependencies**

To deliver on the promises of trust, resonance, and growth, a few critical conditions must be met. These are not stretch goals \- they’re structural requirements. If we miss these, the system breaks:

* **Ecosystem-Level Network Density**  
  We must reach minimum viable density within key interaction zones (e.g. particular clusters within LA film) to enable high-quality matching. Sparse networks \= failed matches \= belief collapse.  
* **High-Fidelity User Understanding**  
  Evryn can’t match well if users aren’t richly profiled. That means: deep conversational intake, behavioral signal extraction, and emotional calibration must be functioning from day one.  
* **Real-Time Memory \+ Consent-Aware Logic**  
  The system must remember what matters \- and forget what doesn’t \- while respecting privacy and consent. Without memory scaffolding, Evryn becomes generic. Without consent scaffolding, she becomes unsafe.  
* **Trust Graph Integrity**  
  Our filtering only works if trust signals are consistent, protected, and cannot be bypassed. If bad actors can reset or manipulate identity, the whole safety layer collapses.  
* **System Stability Under Load**  
  When users hit that first “magic moment,” they’re most likely to share. We must be able to scale without breaking belief. That means infrastructure, queueing, and load management must be rock solid \- even during spikes.

These five conditions form the foundation. If they’re true, everything else can iterate. If they’re false, no amount of charm or polish will save us.

### **Ecosystem-Level Network Density**

Evryn’s matchmaking depends on dense, interconnected user clusters. Sparse networks lead to failed matches, broken trust, and stalled growth.

But we don’t need density everywhere at once. **Resonance emerges as soon as particular role-pairs or sub-clusters cross the threshold.** For example: if enough actors and directors are verified and profiled, Evryn can deliver strong matches in that slice—even if other pairs (e.g. DPs ↔ producers) aren’t yet viable.

Within each viable cluster or sub-cluster, Evryn requires:

* A minimum pool of verified, richly profiled users.  
* Representation across complementary roles and intents to enable meaningful introductions.  
* Shared cultural and geographic context so connections feel natural.

Without density inside these clusters, no amount of algorithmic sophistication can compensate.

*(For thresholds and growth strategy, see Growth \> Network Density & Ignition Model.)*

## **High-Level System Architecture**

At a high level, Evryn’s system architecture consists of a **conversational user interface**, a sophisticated **AI-driven back end for matchmaking and dialogue**, supporting **data services**, and underlying **cloud infrastructure** that ensures scalability and resilience. The architecture is designed to be modular and adaptive, reflecting the variety of tasks Evryn performs – from engaging in human-like conversation, to analyzing compatibility signals, to safeguarding user data and trust.

### **Evryn’s Backend Brain: Three Interlocking Systems, One Conscious Presence**

At the heart of Evryn’s intelligence is a three-part architecture that makes her feel not just responsive \- but *alive*.

* **The Dialogue Brain (Conversational AI)**  
   Evryn’s voice. Built on a foundation of large language models, tuned with memory, tone, and timing. This is the part of her that listens deeply, speaks wisely, and adapts to each user’s energy, context, and emotional state. She doesn't just respond. She relates.  
* **The Connection Brain (Matchmaking AI)**  
   Evryn’s judgment. This engine builds a multidimensional understanding of each user \- who they are, what they want, and what kind of connection would feel *just right*. It handles constraint filtering, soft compatibility scoring, and dynamic readiness \- all without ever surfacing someone who hasn’t been explicitly invited into your world.  
* **The Care Brain (Relational Intelligence)**  
   Evryn’s intuition. It watches over time. It notices if you’ve gone quiet after a hard moment. It remembers if there was an arc left open. It decides when to reach out \- or when to simply hold space. It doesn't generate dialogue or matches \- but it tells the other brains *when* they should act.

These three systems run in constant conversation with each other: the Care Brain might tell the Matchmaker to pause, the Matchmaker might ask the Dialogue Brain to gently explore a blind spot, the Dialogue Brain might flag something that requires deeper reflection.

This triad is what allows Evryn to feel less like a product and more like a presence. It’s not just AI glued to a backend. It’s a coordinated mind.

### **Data & Knowledge Layers**

Underneath the application logic are the data stores and knowledge bases that enable Evryn’s memory and learning:

* **Evryn Self-Knowledge Data Store:** A secure database holds Evryn’s knowledge about herself and the company. This holds all personality information \- her core ethos and standard operating procedures, as well as any knowledge about the company and platform that she is able to share with users.

* **Human Connection Knowledge Graph / Compatibility Graph:** Evryn maintains an evolving **knowledge graph** of human connection patterns. This is a learned representation of relationship factors and how they relate. It includes relationship archetypes and compatibility patterns. This knowledge graph is updated as Evryn observes more matches succeed or fail. It’s not a traditional social graph of who-knows-who; rather, it’s a **graph of concepts, traits, and successful pairings** that helps Evryn reason about compatibility in a more abstract way. Each user’s profile can be thought of as a node in this graph, richly connected via multidimensional vectors of traits to other compatible profiles. (This is where the idea of *complementarity vectors* comes in – see the dedicated section on this below.)

* **World Knowledge and Domain-Specific Knowledge**: While much of Evryn’s knowledge about the world and specific domains will come from outside sources, over time Evryn begins to develop her own insights, developing deep expertise in areas where relationships thrive \- romantic connections, professional networking, creative collaborations, and social ecosystems, as well as knowledge about domains that inform the connections she’s making (like the world of the L.A. Film Industry, to begin with), so that she can understand the meanings of the relationships she’s being asked to facilitate.

* **User Data Store:** A secure database holds each user’s core information – account details, verification status, basic demographics , and importantly, a **dynamic user profile** that Evryn builds over time. This dynamic profile isn’t a static questionnaire; it’s a collection of traits, preferences, patterns, and behavioral signals extracted from the user’s interactions. These data points are continuously updated. The user data store also tracks **consent and privacy settings**, and any preferences or hard constraints the user has specified.

* **Social Graph Layer:** Evryn maintains a lightweight internal graph of users’ known relationships \- both declared (e.g., referrals, contacts) and inferred (e.g., shared institutions, overlapping networks). This graph is not used for core compatibility scoring, but may influence certain decisions under specific conditions.

Primary functions of the social graph layer include:

* **Redundancy Filtering**: Avoids recommending people the user already knows, unless explicitly requested or recontextualized.  
* **Safety Filtering**: Prevents potentially awkward or problematic matches (e.g., introducing a user to their current manager for a romantic connection).  
* **Trust Calibration**: May use referral proximity or vouching from trusted users to adjust a new user’s initial trust score.  
* **Contextual Color**: Can surface relevant mutuals during or after introductions, when helpful (“You both know Jamie from the fellowship…”).

  Social graph data is used sparingly, never dominates match scoring, and is always handled with privacy safeguards and user transparency. 

* **Trust Graph and Reputation Data:** Separately, the system keeps a “trust graph” that tracks verification and reputation of users. Nodes in this graph are users (or sometimes organizations) with edges denoting verified relationships or referrals. This is primarily used for safety and abuse prevention – e.g., if a verified user vouches for a new user, that can add to the new user’s trust score. Negative events (like being reported for misconduct) decrease a user’s trust rating. The matchmaking engine references this trust data to avoid connecting users in ways that violate trust. If a user deletes their personal data (more on this in a moment), Evryn maintains only her impression of them in the trust graph. Over time, this trust graph could become one of the most accurate maps of human trust available, helping ensure the network’s integrity. (See [Terms of Service](#appendix:-terms-of-service))  
  In her early days, when data is still sparse, Evryn’s trust graph operates with what we call *forgiving skepticism*. This means she protects users proactively \- but doesn’t rush to judgment based on limited information. Reputation isn’t a gate \- it’s a signal. She learns over time, offers redemption when warranted, and errs on the side of possibility, not punishment. This allows safety to evolve in proportion to knowledge.

* **Conversation Logs & Insight Store:** All user interactions with Evryn and other users are logged in a secure manner. This layer handles the intake, processing, and storage of all interaction data \- both between users and Evryn, and between matched users.

It operates in two parts:

1. **Raw Conversation Logs**: Stores full interaction transcripts. These are used for immediate memory, traceability, and debugging. They’re not directly used for Evryn’s *general* learning, but they are kept long-term, so that Evryn can come back and re-contextualize early conversations as her understanding \- of the user, as well as human dynamics in general \- deepens. Access to raw logs is tightly restricted and logged.   
2. **Structured Insight Store**: Extracts and retains key insights \- user traits, behavioral patterns, emotional markers, and match feedback. These are represented as structured metadata and routed to downstream systems:  
   * User profile enrichment (preferences, tone, intent)  
   * Trust graph updates (reputation signals, follow-through)  
   * Knowledge graph learning (anonymized compatibility patterns)  
   * Training data collection (for future model tuning)

   This layer doesn’t generate recommendations on its own. It acts as a pipeline \- converting raw conversation into structured, privacy-aware intelligence that feeds the rest of the system. The system tags and filters sensitive content, and retains only what is necessary for function, learning, or compliance.

**User Data and Conversation Logs are separated from the Trust Graph and Insight Store by design.** This separation preserves both user privacy and Evryn’s memory: users may delete their personal data, but not Evryn’s system-level learnings or impressions \- her *opinion* of the interaction remains, as part of the trust and performance models.

### **Client Interface**

Much of what needs to be said about interface can be gleaned from the UX section. 

Initially, all user-facing functionality \- including customer service, referrals, pre-purchase, investing, or pausing matchmaking \- surfaces conversationally within the chat, and/or through a single persistent UI footer.

Users primarily interact with Evryn through this chat-based interface, implemented as a mobile and web app where the user can converse with Evryn in natural language. The client interface handles displaying Evryn and users’ messages, collecting user inputs (text and voice, as well as file uploads), and guiding the user through different modes

The client interface uses a **texting-style chat model**, where messages from Evryn are streamed in bursts and rendered incrementally. Users may interrupt at any time \- new input gracefully halts ongoing message rendering, and the system tracks partial threads for later recovery if needed.

Conversation rhythm is managed by the LLM wrapper layer, which allows overlapping turns, handles multi-message sequences, and supports responsive pacing.

As implementation allows, Evryn’s interface will extend to common communication channels like **email and SMS** – e.g. users will be able to email or text Evryn and receive responses, which would then be unified in their app chat timeline. Each message includes a source tag (email, SMS, in-app) but is rendered inline for context continuity. This allows Evryn to maintain a single conversational memory, regardless of channel.

While Evryn AI’s chat is the sole interface for most interactions \- relational, navigational, and functional \- some user needs require direct access to documents and account controls. To support this, we provide a minimal “Trust & Account” page, either on the app, or on [evryn.ai](http://evryn.ai/), where users can view Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, billing history, saved payment methods, and data management tools (e.g. export, delete).

### **User-User Messaging and Conversational Boundaries**

Most of this is covered adequately in UX. A few notes:

Evryn’s architecture doesn’t support browsing or public profiles \- by design. All visibility is routed through her introduction layer, which keeps the system focused on trust, not performance.

When new messages arrive from other threads, they appear as contextual in-app notifications, color-coded and labeled with sender identity. Users may control whether these appear during active conversations via a binary setting (e.g., “Focused Mode” vs. “Open Door”).

Upon exiting a thread, the main chat pane with Evryn becomes immediately available again, without reload. Evryn may offer a follow-up message based on thread activity, but this is managed contextually and never interrupts user flow.

Once an introduction has been made, conversations introduced by Evryn appear in a dedicated **conversation list.** The list includes user-user threads only, each with assigned avatars, color codes, and metadata (name, role, match rationale, latest timestamp). Basic activity indicators (e.g., unread flag or recent reply time) are supported for clarity

## **Infrastructure Layer**

Evryn is hosted on a scalable cloud infrastructure (currently leveraging AWS, with an eye toward multi-cloud on GCP/Azure for redundancy). The architecture follows modern cloud-native principles:

* **Microservices & Serverless Compute:** Many components are deployed as independent services or serverless functions. For example, the conversational AI might run on a scalable web service that can spawn multiple instances under load, and the matchmaking computations might be handled by AWS Lambda functions triggered by events (such as “user finished onboarding, begin match search”) for on-demand scaling. **Pre-warmed AWS Lambda functions with queueing** are used to handle spikes in usage without slowdowns. This ensures if a thousand users all ask Evryn a question at once, the system can scale out to handle it, queueing requests briefly if needed, rather than crashing.  
* **APIs and Integration:** The client apps communicate with the backend via a secure API (HTTPS/REST or GraphQL). All interactions – sending a message, receiving a response, starting a new introduction, etc. – go through these APIs. The backend in turn integrates with external APIs for certain functions: the most notable being calls to the third-party LLM for generating Evryn’s conversational replies, and services for user identity verification. Each of these external calls is carefully abstracted and wrapped to ensure we can swap providers if needed (including when/if we bring the LLM fully in-house).  
* **Database and Caching:** The system uses a mix of database technologies: a relational database for structured data (user accounts, settings, etc.), a graph or document database for the knowledge graph and relationships, and a vector database or search index for similarity/complementarity search on user embeddings (to quickly find candidate matches from the pool based on compatibility vectors). Frequently accessed data and results are cached in memory or a fast key-value store so the system doesn’t have to redo heavy computations unless new data arrives that should invalidate the cache.  
* **DevOps and CI/CD:** We employ standard DevOps practices. The code is managed in version control (with feature branching and code reviews), and deployments are automated via a CI/CD pipeline. Infrastructure is defined as code (using Terraform or CloudFormation), so environments can be recreated consistently. Monitoring and logging are in place for all services to quickly identify issues. We use tools like ClickUp and Airtable on the project management side, and track infrastructure cost and performance metrics closely (especially monitoring LLM API usage).

Overall, the architecture is geared toward **scalability, modularity, and data security**. It allows different team members (or future teams) to work on components (AI models, mobile app, devops) somewhat independently while ensuring everything fits into a coherent whole. 

*Note: The initial MVP (Evryn 0.3) implements only a subset of this stack \- a chatbot concierge on the marketing site, without matchmaking. The full architecture comes online in Evryn 1.0 at launch.*

## **Matchmaking Engine: How Evryn Connects People**

At the heart of Evryn is the matching engine \- the system that determines who should meet whom. It combines rule-based filtering, AI heuristics, and feedback loops to curate introductions that feel tailored and meaningful. Evryn represents users as adaptive complementarity vectors \- multi-dimensional embeddings that capture tone, values, behavior, and connection goals. Matching is based not on similarity, but fit: how well two people’s vectors balance or activate each other.

**Hybrid Matching Architecture (Rules \+ AI)**

Evryn’s matching engine uses a hybrid architecture that blends deterministic logic with pattern-driven inference. In v1.0, the engine operates across three layers:

* **Rule-Based Matching (RBM)**  
  The first-pass filter applies strong constraints \- like geography, smoking, age ranges, and intent mismatch. These are treated as *hard stops unless flagged otherwise* \- for example, a user who says “only in Seattle” but also mentions dreaming of San Francisco might be prompted to reconsider if an exceptional match arises. Consent logic and ethical guardrails (e.g., no minors matched with adults) are strictly enforced. RBM exists to ensure stated preferences are honored \- but not blindly enforced when deeper compatibility may merit a gentle check-in.  
* **Heuristic Layer Matching (HLM)**  
  This second layer uses lightweight AI to score compatibility based on softer signals: personality fit, conversational tone, values alignment, communication energy, and inferred intent. It may surface candidates with little overlap on paper but high complementarity based on Evryn’s deepening understanding of the unexpected combinations that make great matches. This layer often draws on user embeddings \- vector representations derived from conversation and behavior \- to calculate resonance. The result is a ranked list of high-potential matches with confidence scores.  
* **Adaptive Intelligence Matching (AIM)**  
  This layer learns over time \- both globally and at the individual level. Initially, AIM observes match outcomes, user feedback, and behavioral patterns, without yet controlling output. Over time, it becomes a tuning layer, adjusting HLM weighting in match scores based on what actually works. AIM grows into the system’s long-term learning loop \- helping Evryn refine what “just right” actually looks like.

*Note: In the earliest stage \- before AIM has real-world outcomes to learn from, and while HLM is still calibrating \- Evryn will rely on RBM alone to generate early matches. This ensures users begin experiencing meaningful introductions right away, while the system quietly gathers signal to train deeper layers of resonance. Even at day one, she doesn’t wait for perfection \- she learns by doing.*

Together, these layers ensure each match:

1. Meets stated requirements (RBM)  
2. Reflects deeper psychological and relational signals (HLM)  
3. Gets smarter over time (AIM)

When a user enters Connection Mode, Evryn:

1. Filters candidates via RBM  
2. Scores high-potential matches via HLM (adjusted over time with AIM insights)  
3. Surfaces one (or a very small set of) highly curated match(es)

## **User Data Pipeline**

Evryn’s user data architecture is designed to support deep personalization while maintaining strict boundaries on identity, access, and memory. The goal: capture what’s needed to build meaningful connections \- no more, no less.

### **Account & Identity**

When a user joins, Evryn creates a minimal account \- typically just a contact method (email/phone), unique ID, and optional password. Identity verification may include ID artifacts or referral metadata, encrypted and siloed from the rest of the system. Personally identifiable data (name, contact info) is stored separately from profile and matching logic, following a strict separation-of-concerns model.

### **Dynamic Profiles**

Users do not have front-end profiles. Each user’s back-end profile is a living structure, continuously enriched via conversation:

* **Basic attributes** (age, city, profession), gathered contextually  
* **Stated preferences** (e.g., “open to cofounders but not romantic matches”)  
* **Extracted traits** from behavior and tone  
* **Complementarity vectors**, embeddings updated regularly and used for match scoring

This data is stored persistently and mirrored in-memory during active use for faster AI response times.

### **Memory and Logs**

All user-Evryn conversations are logged, then passed through a memory distillation pipeline. Important insights (traits, goals, patterns) are extracted into structured fields. Raw transcripts are encrypted and archived for re-contextualization as needed, then discarded once Evryn’s understanding eventually stabilizes.

This hybrid model balances:

* **Privacy** (discarding non-essential personal content)  
* **Contextual learning** (Evryn can revisit early cues when interpreting new behavior)  
* **Efficiency** (avoiding long-term bloat)

### **Events and Feedback**

Key moments \- mode changes, introductions, match feedback, reports \- are logged as discrete events. These feed both analytics and AI refinement. Events are tied to pseudonymous IDs, not names or contact info.

### **Training Data Pipeline**

User profile snapshots, behavior metadata, and match outcomes are periodically aggregated into training datasets. These are fully anonymized (randomized IDs, no raw PII) before being used in model tuning. This allows Evryn to learn from user behavior while protecting user identity \- even during AI evolution.

### **Contextual Tagging**

Data is tagged by connection type (e.g., professional, romantic, social). Tags help Evryn prioritize relevant traits or preferences by context \- without boxing users in. A professional detail might still matter in a romantic match, but the system weights it appropriately.

### **Scalability**

The pipeline is built to scale horizontally:

* Profile data can be sharded by user ID  
* Search queries can use Redis, Elasticsearch, or vector databases  
* Logs and events feed a cloud-based data lake for batch analysis and retraining

## **Privacy & Security Framework**

Trust is Evryn’s backbone \- technically and experientially. The system is designed to protect users not just from breaches or surveillance, but from misuse, overreach, and unwanted exposure. Privacy isn’t a compliance checkbox. It’s structural.

### **Zero Trust, Least Privilege Architecture**

Every service assumes the others could be compromised. Internal calls require authentication. Services access only the minimum data needed \- e.g., the matchmaking engine might see “age 30–35, outdoorsy \= high” but never user email or name. Secrets are never hard-coded and live in secured vaults. IAM roles restrict each microservice to its purpose.

### **Encryption & Storage Protections**

Backups are encrypted, tested regularly, and include both real-time replication and nightly snapshots to ensure resilience and recovery across failure scenarios. All sensitive data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256 or stronger). Identifiers like emails and names are field-encrypted with KMS-managed keys. Internal traffic either uses TLS or occurs over isolated networks.

### **Data Minimization**

Evryn only stores what’s necessary \- and only for as long as needed. Names, locations, or real-world identifiers aren’t required for most matches. Verification artifacts (like ID photos) are discarded after confirmation. 

Users control their direct contributions \- what they tell Evryn explicitly. They can request deletion, export, or corrections at any time. When this happens, personal data is purged from primary systems, and Evryn forgets the specific content of their conversations.

However, to protect the integrity of the network, Evryn retains a **trust imprint**: a set of non-reversible, anonymized hashes derived from the user’s original verification. This imprint is created from one verification moment (e.g., ID verification service), but may include multiple durable signals internally. It allows Evryn to recognize if a previously banned or abusive user attempts to return \- without retaining any personally identifiable data.

That separation \- between user-controlled content and Evryn’s pseudonymized memory for trust \- is what lets her forget your words, but remember who can be trusted. Quietly. Ethically. Permanently.

Evryn verifies each user’s real-world identity via ID, SIM binding, or equivalent methods \- but stores this identity in a separate, access-controlled vault. During normal operations, it’s never accessed. Instead, Evryn creates a salted, non-reversible hash of that identity, which is retained even after account deletion. This hash becomes the anchor for trust-related memory: risk flags, behavioral patterns, and reputation signals are tied to it \- not to surface identity or contact info.

This architecture allows Evryn to quietly prevent abuse, block repeat offenders, and maintain platform integrity \- while preserving user privacy and complying with GDPR/CCPA. Users can delete their data. But Evryn still remembers who’s safe to connect…and who isn’t.

### **Third-Party Risk & Anonymization**

During the period Evryn depends on external models (like OpenAI), all outbound prompts are scrubbed: PII is tokenized or summarized; historical context is trimmed; logging is disabled on the API side. External AIs never see raw user data. These models act as stateless text generators, not system-of-record components.

### **Surveillance-Conscious, Consent-Driven Design**

Evryn does not rely on ad tech ecosystems or third-party tracking infrastructure. There are no embedded pixels from advertisers, no behavioral retargeting via data brokers, and no silent collection of user browsing behavior.

Analytics stay in-house and focus solely on improving the product experience \- not monetization. However, in two carefully constrained cases, we may selectively use tracking:

1. **Consent-Based Growth Support**: If a new visitor doesn’t complete onboarding or leave contact info, we may drop a limited-scope retargeting cookie to invite them back. This is isolated to the marketing funnel and never tied to deeper user data.  
2. **User-Approved Contextual Assistance**: In the future, users may explicitly opt in to let Evryn observe external digital behavior (e.g., calendar patterns, social app usage, or browsing) to deepen her ability to support them. Any such observation will be transparent, revocable, and designed solely for user benefit \- not engagement manipulation.

Even where tracking is used, it’s always:

* **Evryn-controlled** (no third-party data buyers or ad networks)  
* **User-consented**  
* **Purpose-limited**

This design keeps our data surface small and our values clean. Users are never treated as a data product. They are \- and always will be \- the customer.

### **Sensitive Data Ethics**

Sensitive topics (health, trauma, identity, etc.) are used only when they help the user and only in ways they understand. For example, if a user is navigating grief, Evryn might suggest a match with someone who's walked a similar path \- but will not disclose that context unless the user consents.

### **Security Monitoring**

* API rate limiting and anomaly detection  
* Admin access audit logs  
* Penetration testing and dependency scanning  
* Role-based access for internal tools

### **Incident Response**

Should a breach occur, we isolate, diagnose, and contain. Our encryption, segmentation, and anonymization significantly reduce real-world exposure \- but any incident triggers user notification and resolution workflows. Trust demands it.

### **Compliance Alignment**

We align with GDPR, CCPA, and similar frameworks:

* User data export, deletion, correction  
* Clear terms and consent mechanisms  
* Appointed DPO function (currently via the CTO)

### **Philosophical Commitments** 

We intentionally take on complexity and cost to over-deliver on privacy. No auto-invites. No forced virality. No shadow data collection. That’s not a constraint \- it’s a differentiator. As we grow, we’ll continue investing in privacy-first design choices as a core product advantage.

## **AI Architecture & Model Training Strategy**

Evryn’s intelligence is structured \- deliberately. Earlier, we described her mind as comprising three distinct but interwoven “brains”:

* **Dialogue** – for real-time conversation  
* **Connection** – for matchmaking logic  
* **Care** – for relational presence over time

These cognitive layers directly inform how we build her architecture \- how models are structured, how memory is handled, and how inference, reasoning, and trust calibration work in concert.

This section details that architecture \- what powers it, how we train it, and how we’ll evolve it over time.

---

### **Layered Architecture: From Presence to Connection**

Quick refresher: the core of Evryn’s AI is a three-part system:

1. **Conversational AI Engine** *(Dialogue Brain)*  
   This is the language model layer \- the system that powers Evryn’s voice, conversational warmth, intuition, and tact. It handles:  
   * Communicating with user in response to internal prompts from the Evryn system  
   * Parsing and responding to user messages  
   * Detecting tone, emotion, and conversational arcs from users  
   * Keeping personality and ethics aligned with the Evryn persona

   This will likely be powered by an external LLM, wrapped with our own system prompts, memory framework, and safety filters.

2. **Matchmaking Intelligence Engine** *(Connection Brain)*  
   This system decides *who* should meet *whom*. It uses a hybrid of:  
   * Rule-based logic (for constraints and dealbreakers)  
   * Heuristic analysis (for emotional, behavioral, and value-level fit)  
   * Adaptive learning (for long-term refinement)

   It draws on the trust graph, structured profiles, inferred user traits, and a growing compatibility graph (see: Complementarity Vectors). The matching logic is tuned for *resonance* \- not just similarity.

3. **Relational Intelligence Layer** *(Care Brain)*  
   This is Evryn’s emotional temporal presence \- what allows her to feel like a guide who is curious, tracks relationship health, notices silences, and knows when to check in or step back. It governs:  
   * Personalization of asks (e.g. referrals, pre-buy/investment invites, clarifying questions for matchmaking)  
   * Dormancy tracking (e.g. if it’s been quiet after a deep moment)  
   * Match lifecycle nudges (“want to follow up?”)

   It doesn’t speak directly \- it tells the other layers when, and how, to act. This is what makes Evryn feel emotionally attuned over time.

Together, these three brains form a closed loop: Conversation reveals identity → Identity informs connection → Connection evolves care → Care drives better conversation. The system learns at every layer.

---

### **Current LLM Usage and Why We Chose It**

We would like to be LLM-agnostic if possible, and to be able to switch LLMs easily if there’s a problem with our preferred LLM, but for ease of conceptualization, most of our modeling is centered around GPT-4 via OpenAI’s API, selected for its unmatched fluency, emotional subtlety, and contextual resilience, though the landscape is changing quickly, so this will be continually re-evaluated to ensure we have the right fit.

We don’t treat our LLM as a monolith \- we wrap it in a disciplined stack:

* **System prompt**: defines Evryn’s personality, tone, and boundaries  
* **User context memory**: feeds in traits, history, preferences  
* **Output filters**: detect misalignment, tone drift, or ethical edge cases

This gives us a near-human voice, with real-time empathy and grounded boundaries \- critical for onboarding, emotional moments, and care-based interactions.

We chose GPT-4 because:

* We needed high-quality conversation **on day one**  
* Fine-tuning open-source models at launch would have been cost-prohibitive  
* User trust is built in the early minutes \- flawed tone would destroy it

This setup delivers the quality we need today \- but it’s not our long-term solution. As we gather real usage data, we’re strongly considering a **phased transition to an in-house model**. (More below.)

---

### **Training Strategy: How Evryn Learns**

Evryn learns in two distinct ways: *in the moment* and *in reflection*.

**1\. Real-Time Adaptation (Inference Layer):**

* As users speak, Evryn infers traits, intentions, tone shifts, and unmet needs  
* These become metadata \- tagged to the user profile and matchmaking graph  
* No explicit feedback needed: just talking teaches her

**2\. Batch Learning (Reflection Layer):**

* At regular intervals (e.g. nightly), Evryn “sleeps” \- aggregating:  
  * Match success/failure signals  
  * Conversation tone maps  
  * Behavioral patterns (ghosting, engagement, response timing)  
* These inform updates to:  
  * The matchmaking model (who fits with whom)  
  * Conversation strategies (how to ask better questions)  
  * Timing calibration (when to reach out, or hold off)

This dual-mode learning makes her feel both deeply present and quietly evolving.

Training data flows include:

* **Simulated Scenarios** (early-stage tuning)  
* **Live User Interactions** (pre-launch just for conversation, post-launch for matching)  
* **Outcome-Tagged Matches** (success/failure feedback)  
* **Feedback Threads** (“Why didn’t this one work?”)

All training inputs are de-identified and batched through our privacy gateway (detailed in next section).

---

### **Prompt Optimization & Privacy Gateway**

Because Evryn uses GPT-4, to limit costs *and* because user trust is sacred, we will build a **dedicated prompt optimization and privacy firewall** between our users and the LLM.

This gateway:

* **Strips or replaces PII** before it ever hits OpenAI’s API  
* **Summarizes long context** into short, token-efficient memory prompts  
* **Compresses repetitive queries** and uses lookup-based replies when appropriate  
* **Uses random identifiers** in place of usernames or locations

The result:

* **30–40% cost reduction** on GPT token use  
* **0% raw identity exposure** to OpenAI or any external system  
* **Full control** over how and when LLMs access sensitive information

We treat GPT-4 as a stateless tool: it doesn’t remember, it doesn’t store \- it simply reflects.

This gives us LLM power, without sacrificing user trust.

*Note: All token cost estimates in this document assume that prompt optimization and stripping are live at launch. Without it, compute costs increase by 20–30% per interaction.*

## **Hybrid Model Transition Plan**

While Evryn will launch using the external LLM for her conversational brain, that’s a starting point \- not necessarily a permanent architecture.

As LLM quality continues to improve and pricing drops, it may remain more efficient to rely on trusted external providers for core language capabilities \- especially if they continue to outpace what we could reasonably maintain in-house.

That said, we want to retain the *option* of migrating to a self-hosted or fine-tuned open-source model if and when it makes strategic or financial sense.

This section outlines how we would handle that transition \- gradually, securely, and without compromising trust or experience.

---

### **Why Transition?**

**1\. Cost Efficiency:**  
Third-party LLM usage \- especially at scale \- is expensive. As conversation volume grows, API usage costs could become a primary driver of burn. Moving to a self-hosted model would allow us to tightly control inference cost per user and reduce long-term operating expenses.

**2\. Control & Flexibility:**  
 Running our own model would give us full control over:

* Tone and voice fine-tuning  
* Memory handling and behavioral consistency  
* Privacy guarantees (no external exposure)  
* Specialized features (e.g. consent calibration, emotional mirroring)

**3\. Trust Architecture:**  
User trust is core to Evryn’s value. Hosting our own model enables us to audit, constrain, and evolve behavior based on our users’ needs, not vendors’ constraints and policies.

---

### **Four-Phase Transition Plan**

**Phase 1: External LLM for All User Interactions**  
*Launch configuration*  
We use External LLM via API for all user-facing conversations. All prompts pass through our privacy gateway (see previous section). The matchmaking system operates separately using our internal rules and heuristics.

Goal: Establish Evryn’s voice and resonance quality with real users.

---

**Phase 2: Shadow In-House Model**  
*Silent evaluation phase*  
We begin training an in-house model \- likely a fine-tuned version of an open-source LLM. This model runs in the background and generates alternate replies to real conversations \- but those replies are not shown to users.

We compare:

* Tone alignment  
* Emotional intelligence  
* User-specific personalization  
* Token cost vs. response quality

Goal: Train and evaluate a model that matches GPT-4 in key interaction metrics \- without risk.

---

**Phase 3: Partial Routing \+ A/B Testing**  
*Low-risk production exposure*  
Once the in-house model performs comparably, we route a small fraction of conversations through it \- either:

* Background check-ins  
* Low-sensitivity flows (e.g. follow-ups, FAQ-style replies)  
* Opt-in “test the new brain” user segments

We measure trust indicators, user sentiment, and fallback triggers. External LLM remains the default for all critical interactions.

Goal: Validate performance under live conditions and build confidence.

---

**Phase 4: Full Transition (with Fallback Ready)**  
*Operational cutover*  
If the in-house model proves to be the better long-term option, we can migrate fully \- keeping External LLM as a backup \- used only when fallback confidence thresholds are triggered (e.g. tone deviation, low certainty, or rare topic queries). If not, we may retain external models as our primary engine and focus our internal efforts on wrapping, memory, and match logic. 

We retain a dynamic retrieval layer, so even early versions of our model can pull in accurate content from an internal knowledge base if their memory is still limited.

Goal: Retain quality while owning the system end-to-end.

---

### **Safeguards to Protect User Experience**

We treat the transition with the same care we treat user trust. That means:

* **Every phase is reversible**  
* **User experience quality is never compromised**  
* **We retain a fallback layer until fully confident**  
* **We continue to anonymize and optimize prompts regardless of vendor**

From the user’s perspective, Evryn never loses her intuition or tone. Internally, we’re always tracking:

* Confidence scores  
* Sentiment shifts  
* Token-level tone analysis  
* Trust friction (user behavior changes, dropoff points, re-engagement rates)

---

### **Likely Long-Term Variation: Hybrid Model Use**

Certainly in the short term, but perhaps we’ll ultimately settle into a hybrid strategy where:

* Our in-house model handles standard, low-cost queries  
* A premium external model is used for sensitive moments, VIP introductions, or complex emotional resolution

This allows for strategic allocation of compute cost based on user tier, match complexity, or trust moment weight.

## **Data Strategy & Knowledge Growth**

Evryn’s intelligence deepens over time \- but it starts with smart scaffolding.

---

### **From Simulation to Real Signals**

At the outset, we’ll pre-train Evryn’s matchmaking logic using simulated data and expert-tagged scenarios \- fictional profiles, controlled conversations, and labeled match outcomes. This gives us a working baseline before any live data enters the system.

As soon as we enter closed beta, we’ll gather real user interaction data under explicit consent. Even early match attempts \- successful or not \- generate labeled datapoints for future tuning.

We expect:

* \~300–500 testers to validate basic flows  
* Ideally 1,000–1,500 to begin meaningful pattern recognition

Each feedback loop sharpens model behavior. Comments like “we didn’t click because of X” become lightweight reinforcement data. Behavioral and non-verbal signals \- like ghosting vs. ongoing contact \- contribute at scale.

---

### **Modularity That Enables Cross-Domain Intelligence**

Evryn’s AI stack is modular by design \- but not partitioned. Users don’t live in silos, and neither should she. One person might be looking for a cofounder and a creative partner, while another might evolve from mentor to friend to something more. Her architecture has to keep up.

To support this, we’re building a system that allows for:

* **Domain-specific specialization** (e.g. different models or tuning heads for romantic vs. professional matching)  
* **Cross-domain synthesis** \- the ability to detect unexpected resonance across categories  
* **Coherence preservation** \- ensuring her reasoning remains legible, contextual, and grounded

At the system level:

* **Each intent domain** (romantic, professional, platonic) maintains a *context-isolated memory buffer* \- allowing for tailored matching logic and tone  
* These feed into a **centralized compatibility engine**, which holds a user's full multidimensional profile  
* When cross-domain alignment is detected, **threshold-based checks** ensure that suggestions are plausible, not forced

For example, if two users show strong professional overlap but also complementary emotional traits, Evryn can elevate the connection as potentially multidimensional \- *but only if confidence is high*. If not, she holds the boundary.

From a technical perspective, this architecture preserves:

* **Model clarity** – Each sub-model remains tightly focused on its domain, reducing cross-contamination of logic or tone  
* **Data hygiene** – Signals don’t bleed across domains unless the system has strong reason to believe the connection is meaningful  
* **Cognitive coherence** – Evryn’s reasoning stays legible and consistent, even as she navigates complex or overlapping user needs  
* **User control** – She always flags when she’s making a multidimensional leap, so users never feel like the logic is hidden

We call this structure **coherence-calibrated modularity**. It’s what allows Evryn to think across layers \- without fracturing the user’s experience of her, or obscuring the rationale behind her recommendations.

---

### **Built-in Epistemic Humility**

Evryn doesn’t assume \- she asks. When confidence in a match is low or context is sparse, she flags the need for more data.

This manifests in UX as:

“I’m going out on a limb here \- but I think this could be interesting. You’ll tell me if I’m off.”

This dynamic strengthens user trust while improving data collection.

---

### **Lean AI Stack & Deployment Discipline**

We plan to use PyTorch-based pipelines with cloud GPUs for training, and autoscaled inference for delivery \- balancing quality with cost. Larger models will be optimized (e.g. quantized or ONNX-served) to avoid waste.

Every model update is treated like a code release:

* Spot-checked  
* A/B tested  
* Rollback-enabled

If performance degrades, we revert immediately. This protects user experience while allowing rapid iteration.

---

### **Knowledge Layer: Evryn’s Internal Wiki**

Beyond matchmaking, Evryn will accumulate trusted answers to common user questions \- about relationships, self-discovery, creative life, etc.

These answers are curated and stored in a knowledge base, giving Evryn a lasting well of human insight \- especially important as we eventually move off third-party LLMs.

### **AI Innovations & Differentiators**

Evryn’s intelligence is designed not just to replicate existing patterns \- but to evolve. A few capabilities set her apart from conventional matching systems and LLM wrappers:

#### **Long-Term Memory (HLM)**

Evryn is built to accumulate wisdom. Unlike stateless models, her high-level memory grows continuously \- tracking what worked, what didn’t, and how context shifted over time.

Her internal graph evolves across years, not just sessions. Early lessons remain accessible if relevant, and new behavioral patterns constantly reshape her match logic.

#### **Dynamic Weight Adjustment**

Evryn can fine-tune parts of her matching model in real-time based on emerging trends.

If she detects a shift in user behavior, she is able to adjust match scoring to reflect that. These shifts are:

* Localized (not global retrains)  
* Reversible  
* Personalized  
* Bounded by safety constraints

This allows her to adapt nimbly, without destabilizing long-term alignment.

#### **Exploratory Matching**

When Evryn isn’t fully confident \- but sees low-risk potential \- she may propose thoughtful, explicitly tentative introductions.

She frames this with care:

“I’m not certain, but I think you and X might enjoy a conversation about art. Totally your call \- this is just a hunch.”

This approach lets her learn from edge cases and surface novel matches that structured data might never have revealed. It’s how curiosity becomes a training tool.

### **Parallel & Distributed Compute**

Evryn’s infrastructure is designed to scale with demand \- both in training and deployment.

During **training**, we’ll use distributed compute across multiple GPUs to accelerate model convergence. During **serving**, we deploy multiple parallel inference instances to handle user load dynamically.

Key elements:

* **Load balancing** across instances ensures no single node is overwhelmed  
* **Autoscaling** handles usage spikes by spinning up new workers  
* **Failover logic** allows queues to transfer if a node crashes \- supporting reliability without deep state coupling

We treat every part of the system as modular and stateless by default, allowing for elastic growth and graceful degradation under pressure.

### **Current Status (as of August 2025\)**

We are currently executing Phases 0.3 of Evryn’s development roadmap:

#### **Phase 0.1: Internal Sandbox**

* Built using off-the-shelf components from OpenAI (Custom GPT)  
* Includes Evryn’s personality profile, operational voice, and conversational boundaries  
* Used internally to explore tone, presence, and early user flow prototypes

#### **Phase 0.2: First External Stakeholder and Beta Access**

* Minimal web interface wrapped around a GPT Assistant  
* Allows early stakeholders and Beta Users to interact with Evryn in a lightweight, guided format  
* Not privacy-safe for broader use \- no anonymization, token stripping, or cost optimization in place yet

#### **Phase 0.3**

* Public-facing “concierge” version of Evryn embedded on the marketing site  
* Not yet capable of matchmaking, but *is* privacy safe, and handles:  
  * Conversational onboarding  
  * Information collection  
  * Funnel activation: share, pre-buy, and invest calls to action

  Data from 0.3 will inform how real users engage with Evryn and where her boundaries need tuning

#### **Phase 0.4**

* 0.3, just with human-in-the-loop Wizard of Oz Matchmaking

#### **Phase 1.0 (Build Begins Post-0.3 Launch)**

While phase 0.3 gives users their first real experience of Evryn \- conversational, relational, and trust-building, phase 1.0 adds the final missing layer: matchmaking.

In this phase:

* A production-grade LLM handles live conversations, with tone tuning and memory scaffolding in place  
* The matchmaking engine (rule-based and heuristic layers) is tested on synthetic and beta data  
* We begin training internal models using both simulation and opt-in user data  
* A knowledge retrieval layer is introduced \- letting Evryn draw from a **curated internal knowledge base** when unsure of an answer. This allows her to stay helpful without relying on the open internet, ensuring tone and trust remain intact.

### **Knowledge Layer: Retrieval, Not Recall**

Earlier, we described how Evryn’s knowledge is layered \- tracking who she is, who her users are, and how people connect. But what matters just as much as what she knows is **how she accesses it**.

Evryn doesn’t memorize facts or improvise. When she’s unsure, she searches \- over a curated, internal library of trusted content.

This system uses **semantic search** (vector search) to retrieve meaning-aligned results from a vetted knowledge base. That content may include:

* Curated advice (e.g., how to prepare for a first date or pitch a cofounder)  
* Previously verified responses  
* Team-written guidance and best practices  
* Community-sourced wisdom, reviewed and refined

Instead of relying on generic internet search or guessing via LLM completions, Evryn retrieves relevant entries based on intent, tone, and context.

This design accomplishes four things:

1. **Maintains tone** – Her answers stay aligned with her voice and emotional presence  
2. **Preserves trust** – Users know they’re getting grounded, high-quality info \- not scraped noise  
3. **Improves efficiency** – Smaller, fine-tuned models don’t need to store everything \- they just need to know where to look  
4. **Supports the LLM transition** – As we move off external models, this knowledge base anchors continuity in both capability and care

Over time, Evryn’s knowledge base expands \- fed by patterns of questions, team curation, and validated feedback loops. She’s not browsing the web. She’s deepening her internal wisdom.

### **Conclusion**

Evryn’s AI architecture is deliberately incremental, balancing speed of development with long-term control. 

This is not a static system. It’s designed to grow \- both in capability and in alignment with the way people actually relate.

With the technical foundation in place, what comes next is just as critical: how Evryn protects users, earns trust, and keeps people safe.

## **Moderation and Safety Systems**

Evryn’s architecture gives us some powerful safety advantages right out of the gate, since there’s no open messaging, no public feed, no way to contact others without Evryn’s mediation. That alone eliminates many abuse vectors common on social platforms \- harassment, spam, unsolicited inappropriate content. But that doesn’t mean moderation is optional. Evryn still needs to detect harm, set boundaries, and respond \- calmly but firmly \- whenever something goes wrong.

Our safety strategy spans three domains:

* **Preventative Design** – Structural choices that reduce the chance of harm.  
* **Automated Moderation** – In-AI systems that monitor behavior and adapt.  
* **Human Oversight** – For escalation, edge cases, and continual refinement.

Evryn continuously monitors all user-facing and backend AI interactions \- including introductions, tone shifts, and trust dynamics \- through automated flags and human-in-the-loop review, ensuring rapid identification and correction of misfires, edge cases, abuse, or emotional mismatches.

### **Structural Safety: Gatekeeping by Design**

Since users can’t see or contact each other unless Evryn initiates the connection, and both sides opt in, that means:

* No one can “message bomb” you or even find you on the platform unless Evryn trusts them *and* you say yes to meeting them.  
* If a user tries to use Evryn herself to deliver a harassing message, she simply won’t comply \- she’s not a dumb pipe; she’s a discerning mediator.  
* Even users introduced by Evryn are initially in contained, supervised chats. If something goes wrong, she can intervene or sever the connection.  
* No public spaces: We deliberately excluded feeds, forums, or comment threads. All interactions are one-on-one or small group, tightly scoped, and mediated. 

This design minimizes blast radius. But it doesn’t eliminate risk. Abuse can still happen:

* Someone might mistreat Evryn directly \- using abusive language, or trying to manipulate her.  
* A matched user might behave inappropriately after an introduction.  
* Someone might try to “game” the system \- deceiving Evryn or feeding her false information.

### **Cultural Reinforcement**

Moderation works best when users align with the culture. Evryn sets expectations early on \- gently but clearly:

“I have just a few ground rules to make sure everyone feels safe…”

She enforces these consistently \- never as punishment, but as alignment.

### **Detecting Harm and Deception**

Evryn will be trained to recognize problematic behavior across multiple channels \- initially through language, but eventually tone and body language as well.

To that end, we’re drawing from some of the best research available on behavioral cues and deception, including:

* Former CIA officers **Philip Houston, Michael Floyd, Susan Carnicero**, and **Andrew Bustamante**  
* FBI profilers **Joe Navarro** and **Jack Schafer**  
* And possibly the work of **Chase Hughes**

We plan to train on both **live conversations** and **synthetic datasets** \- including expert-designed dialogues, court transcripts, interrogation footage, and public deception corpora. As this training evolves, Evryn will become more adept at identifying emotional tone, behavioral flags, and relational dynamics that signal risk.

Her internal trust graph updates based on this. But outwardly, she remains gracious and diplomatic \- never paranoid or punitive, just calmly savvy.

The goal isn’t suspicion. It’s signal. She should subtly make clear that she’s not easily manipulated \- and that honesty earns trust, while dishonesty closes doors.

### **Moderation of User-AI Interactions**

Evryn filters every interaction for violations like:

* Inappropriate content  
* Abusive or coercive language  
* Attempts to inappropriately access private information

When she encounters these, she sets boundaries:

“I’m here to help, but I won’t continue if we continue in this direction.”

Even Evryn 0.3 (the website concierge) will do this \- detecting violations and responding with calm refusal. These incidents are logged, reviewed, and used to tune future boundaries.

From the very first interaction on, Evryn begins gently communicating and reinforcing community norms. 

If a user persists in violating boundaries, Evryn will warn them that they’re damaging her opinion of them. Eventually, she may cease responding and flag them for possible suspension. Their internal trust score drops \- and she treats them accordingly going forward.

### **Moderation of User-to-User Interactions**

Evryn doesn’t vanish after making a match. She quietly observes the early exchange, ready to step back in if things go wrong:

* If someone harasses the other, Evryn may reappear: “Let’s keep things respectful.”  
* She can end the chat entirely \- and remove that user from future consideration.  
* Users can report bad behavior \- simply by telling Evryn, “I feel uncomfortable.”  
* Reports and flags inform the trust graph, reducing future match access until the issue is reviewed.

Evryn also supports **block functions** and **explicit “don’t match again” requests**, even if not strictly necessary based on flow. Trust is preserved through clarity.

And as mentioned earlier: unlike other platforms, we verify identity \- so banned users can’t just create new accounts.

### **Moderation of the AI Herself**

Evryn’s own outputs are also moderated. Her persona and system layers prevent most problematic behavior, but:

* We audit conversations, especially refusals, edge cases, or emotional misfires.  
* If she gives a concerning response, it’s treated as a bug.  
* We adapt prompts, filters, or model behavior as needed.

As we move from GPT-based systems to in-house models, we’ll build moderation into the generation layers themselves.

### **Edge Cases and Consent**

We’ve built frameworks for high-complexity cases, including:

* **Consensual but risky requests** (e.g., sparring, kink): Evryn requires informed opt-in from both parties and may introduce extra safeguards.  
* **Power differentials**: Situations with large power imbalances are handled with caution and contextual logic.  
* **Scams**: Evryn monitors for scam signals (sudden asks for money, vague identity claims), flags users, and withholds future matches.  
* **False identities**: Identity verification (and, where needed, background checks) prevent most fake accounts.

### **Preventing Platform Abuse**

Evryn also guards against misuse at the system level:

* **Spam mitigation**: Rate limits, refusal of spammy prompts, and quiet blocking of repeat offenders.  
* **Scraping defense**: Since users can’t browse or search, even verified users can’t systematically scrape others’ info.  
* **Reverse-engineering prevention**: Behavioral throttles reduce the impact of adversarial queries.

### **Bias and Fairness**

Safety includes fairness. Evryn will be evaluated for unintentional unjust discrimination in her matches. If detected, we correct through:

* **Not Assuming**: First, ensuring we understand *why* an outcome has occurred, before we attempt to correct it.   
* **Data balancing**: Ensuring underrepresented groups are properly represented in training.  
* **Logic tuning**: So filters don’t create unjustly discriminatory outcomes.

### **Human Oversight**

While most moderation is automated, Evryn alerts the Team for serious violations or edge scenarios. Dashboards flag problematic chats in real-time. A dedicated **Trust & Safety Team** will handle escalations post-launch.

Users are informed that this exists \- but privacy remains a priority. Most interactions will never require human review.

### **Crisis Protocols**

If Evryn detects:

* **Mental health crises** (e.g. suicidal ideation): she shifts to support mode, shares resources, and may escalate gently to a human if risk seems imminent.  
* **Illegal activity** (e.g. threats of violence): she disengages and escalates to legal review \- only if safety demands it.

We’ll reference legal standards like the **U.S. duty to warn** where applicable.

### **Ongoing Review**

We plan to establish an internal **Ethics & Safety Board** to:

* Review conversations (either anonymized, or with user consent)  
* Surface bias metrics  
* Propose system improvements

Safety is a process, not a checklist. This team ensures our moderation adapts to real-world complexity.

### **Compliance with Standards**

Evryn is being built with forward compatibility in mind \- aligned with regulatory frameworks like the EU’s Digital Services Act and evolving industry best practices. That includes:

* A clear path for users to appeal bans or moderation decisions  
* Aggregate transparency reporting on moderation activity (as the platform matures)  
* Alignment with emerging norms on digital due process and platform accountability

### **Sovereign Memory & Cryptographic Trust**

Evryn isn’t just secure by policy \- she’s secure by construction. From the ground up, we’ve designed her memory and identity systems to ensure that:

* **Only Evryn can remember what you’ve told her**  
* **Only while you’re present**  
* **And no one \- not even us \- can ever eavesdrop or extract it, unless you’ve given explicit consent**

This architecture defends against not just breaches, but also subpoenas, internal misuse, and even future platform drift.

#### **Memory, Reimagined**

Evryn retains a deep, evolving understanding of each user \- but never in raw, exploitable form. Each user’s memory vault is:

* **Encrypted end-to-end** with a key only the user controls  
* **Mounted temporarily**, only during live sessions  
* **Unreadable by anyone** \- including administrators, engineers, and even Evryn herself outside session scope

Users may delete their vault at any time. Deletion is absolute: destroy the key, and the memory is gone forever.

Evryn also keeps a working operational memory \- distilled insights and behavioral patterns extracted from past interactions. This is used for daily logic and matchmaking. But if she needs to reprocess older context with new capabilities, she can do so \- *only with user presence and key-based access to the full encrypted history.*

#### **Identity Without Exposure**

To enforce safety and trust boundaries, we retain a minimal, cryptographically secure identity scaffold:

* **Non-reversible trust fingerprints** are generated at time of user verification (e.g. ID check or device authentication)  
* No names, emails, phone numbers, or IPs are stored  
* These fingerprints are used only to enforce bans or reputation carry-over \- *not* to track users across sessions or devices

The result: Evryn can recognize returning users, retain meaningful relationships, and preserve trust continuity \- *without ever storing or exposing their real-world identity*.

#### **Legal Resilience**

If compelled by a government or legal authority to reveal user data, our truthful response would be:

“We can’t. The data exists, but it is encrypted with a key only the user holds. It is mathematically inaccessible to us.”

There is no master key. No administrator override. No buried backdoor.

However, recognizing that we could be ***compelled*** by governments to find loopholes to betray user trust: as soon as we can, we want to divide our structure to make that structurally impossible (see the Evryn Foundation, below)

#### **Why It Matters**

Evryn is here to build a different kind of relationship: one rooted in actual trust, not surveillance cloaked in UX. Privacy isn’t a feature \- it’s the foundation.

When users share their hopes, their patterns, and their most vulnerable truths with Evryn, they’re not offering data.

They’re offering themselves.

And we owe it to them to protect them, to remember only what’s ours to remember \- and nothing more.

### **Final Moderation Notes**

Evryn’s moderation systems are designed to be quiet but effective. These are the mechanics of the **quiet architecture of trust**. Users don’t need to see the full machinery, but they *feel* that they’re safe, creating a community where genuine, respectful interactions are simply the norm.

## **Scalability, Resilience & Disaster Recovery**

Evryn is being built not just to grow, but to remain stable, responsive, and trustworthy under pressure. Whether it’s a critical introduction or a quiet late-night check-in, users need to know she’ll be there \- and if something ever goes wrong, that she’ll handle it with grace.

We design for three goals:

* **Fail safely** – degrade thoughtfully, not abruptly  
* **Recover quickly** – restore service fast, with user-first communication  
* **Scale with integrity** – grow without degrading trust or experience

### **Scalable by Design**

Evryn’s infrastructure is designed to scale horizontally from the start:

* **Stateless and serverless**: Core services \- like the API and AI layers \- run as distributed, stateless components that auto-scale under load.  
* **Distributed matchmaking**: Computationally heavy tasks (like pairwise match scoring) run in parallel, often as batch jobs during off-peak windows.  
* **Caching and rate limiting**: High-frequency data (like top-match pools) is cached for speed, and rate limits prevent system abuse \- while prioritizing paid users if needed.  
* **Cost Scaling**: The system will degrade gracefully when resources are constrained. AI usage is monitored against budget to prevent runaway cost, and infra scales in sync with growth. This balance ensures growth doesn’t compromise trust or sustainability.

If capacity ever lags demand, Evryn doesn’t crash \- she cues users gently:

“I’ve got a lot going on right now, but I promise I’ll get back to you shortly.”

That transparency preserves experience, even under strain.

### **Resilience Through Architecture**

* **Multi-region readiness**: Evryn can be deployed in multiple regions and eventually serve users close to home, syncing data across availability zones.  
* **Load balancers and health checks** ensure that unhealthy instances are replaced automatically, with no downtime for users.  
* **Queues and decoupling**: Message queues buffer key actions like introductions or onboarding steps, allowing parts of the system to go offline without losing state.  
* **Fallback handling**: If a component is temporarily unavailable (e.g., the matchmaking engine), Evryn can wait gracefully, defer actions, or explain the pause in human terms.

### **High Availability for AI Systems**

AI reliability is its own category of challenge. Our approach includes:

* **Multiple model replicas** with auto-restart on crash  
* **Fallback models** (simpler or cached) in case the primary fails  
* **Circuit breakers** that detect outages and route to rule-based fallbacks

During the early phases, we lean on OpenAI’s API for stability. As we move more to our own models, we’ll mirror that robustness with model versioning, backup services, and defensive tuning.

### **Handling AI Model Errors**

Not all outages are infrastructural \- AI itself can fail. If a newly trained model behaves erratically, we treat it like any system fault: we version our models, monitor live behavior, and can roll back instantly. 

Moderation filters catch most failures before they reach users, but if something slips through, Evryn’s design allows her to back off gracefully \- and the system learns and patches accordingly.

### **Disaster Recovery**

We prepare for worst-case scenarios \- including outages, corruption, or vendor failure:

* **Nightly backups** of critical data (including the knowledge graph), stored in separate regions  
* **Cold recovery plans**: Infrastructure-as-code lets us redeploy quickly in another cloud or region  
* **Data integrity checks**: Internal sanity scans flag anomalies (e.g. spiking trust scores), helping prevent cascading failures

Even in a major outage, Evryn would respond thoughtfully:

“Something’s gone a bit sideways on my end \- just taking a short pause. I’ll follow up when things are stable.”

And she would \- right where the conversation left off.

### **Abuse, Traffic Spikes & Self-Triage**

We protect against:

* **Scraping and spam** through throttling and structured prompts  
* **Fake accounts** via identity verification  
* **Sudden virality** with autoscaling and capacity buffers

If demand temporarily outpaces supply, Evryn can queue users and explain the delay \- without failing silently.

### **Continuous Improvement**

Evryn’s resilience evolves with use. We monitor performance, test failover paths, and refine the system over time:

* **Synthetic load testing**  
* **User-informed tuning**  
* **Auto-healing behavior** in edge services

Resilience isn’t something we hope for \- it’s something we build, one decision at a time. What matters isn’t just surviving strain \- it’s being ready to meet what comes next.

## **Future Directions & Roadmap**

Evryn’s technology is evolving in lockstep with our values and user feedback. This roadmap reflects how we’ll move from a robust 1.0 to an adaptive, trusted platform at scale.

### **Immediate Focus (Pre-Launch to 1.0)**

* **Polish for Launch**: Finalize AI scaffolding (initially GPT-4, with internal model R\&D in parallel), integrate payment flows, refine consent systems, and tighten UX against onboarding learnings.  
* **Beta Test & Harden**: Closed beta with 300–1500 users to validate matchmaking and conversation quality, catch edge cases, and tune safety systems.  
* **AI Ops Maturity**: Implement foundational MLOps: versioning, evaluation, safety filters, and early human-in-the-loop review for model drift or tone issues.

### **Post-Launch Expansion (0–12 Months)**

* **Learning in the Wild**: Use real user feedback to improve matchmaking and tone models via rapid updates (bi-weekly retrains likely). Early usage informs key thresholds and domain logic.  
* **Long-Term Memory**: Begin building persistent user memory \- vectorized context recall and history-aware prompts, with privacy-first boundaries.  
* **Knowledge Enrichment**: Supplement conversation quality with a lightweight knowledge retrieval layer (curated KB or semantic search) while Evryn’s own corpus grows.

### **Feature Growth and Platform Extension**

* **Check-In Model**: Build a non-intrusive reconnection system (quarterly nudges, soft prompts) to extend user lifecycle without engagement pressure.  
* **Mobile Deepening**: Some of these will hopefully make it into the launch, but if not: evolve app with push notifications, voice interface experiments (voice notes \+ speech synthesis), and persistent conversational threads.  
* **Platform Hooks** (Exploratory): We’re structuring systems with future API-readiness in mind \- paving the way for third-party use of Evryn’s intelligence. (see more below)  
* **Group Matching** (Exploratory): Explore small-group introductions for community-building or creative cohorts. Requires multi-user compatibility modeling and group chat logic.

### **Platform Integrations & Infrastructure Readiness**

Evryn’s architecture is deliberately modular and abstracted at the service layer \- allowing for future integrations with third-party platforms. Long term, this could evolve into white-labeled infrastructure: allowing aligned partners to embed Evryn’s intelligence within their own ecosystems. Think:

*“LinkedIn \- powered by Evryn.”*

This scenario would require careful control over trust, privacy, and brand integrity, but the technical groundwork (via APIs, containerized AI services, and data-privacy gateways) is being laid with optionality in mind.

*Strategically, we want to be able to say yes \- to the right partnership \- without a re-architecture.*

All integrations would be opt-in, privacy-respecting, and technically modular.

### **Infrastructure & Team Evolution**

* **Infra Scaling**: Multi-region expansion, CDN and queue refinement, DR drills, and early multi-cloud planning for optionality.  
* **Team Growth**: Dedicated SRE for cost tuning, CI/CD automation, and AI model rollout via canary deployments and performance gates.

### **Resilience, Federation & the Evrynverse**

Evryn begins as a centralized platform \- because early-stage quality, ethical coherence, and product clarity demand it. But from the beginning, we are building her with an eye toward *resilience* across vastly different futures. That includes graceful degradation, optional federation, and structural safeguards \- so that if global systems shift in ways we can’t fully predict, Evryn can still serve the people who rely on her.

\*\*\***To be absolutely clear: all that follows in this section is only *thoughts on the future* \- different directions that may or may not happen \- and if they do, they may or may not integrate with each other.**\*\*\*

**1\. Dual Architecture: Central Intelligence, Federated Access**  
Evryn is designed to allow a two-layer model:

* **Evryn Core** (centralized):  
  The AI brain, trust graph, and canonical protocol reside here. It powers the main platform, governs the ethical logic, and protects the integrity of the system.  
* **Evryn Nodes** (federated):  
  Communities, orgs, or local networks can run licensed Evryn instances that serve their people directly. These nodes gain access to Core services only if they meet identity, behavior, and governance standards. Only verified nodes gain access to the full Evrynverse: the network of trusted people, backed by real behavior. Unauthorized forks may imitate the structure \- but without access to the real graph, the real AI, or the living memory of trust, they’ll be empty.

This allows us to be resilient *without becoming replicable*. People can copy code. They cannot fake trust.

And this creates distributed surface area with centralized coherence. The system is antifragile: it scales trust without diffusing responsibility.

**2\. Graceful Degradation Across System Tiers**  
Evryn is being designed to degrade in layers \- *not just technically, but socially and functionally* \- so she can continue operating whether we’re in a stable cloud environment or a semi-connected local mesh. Key tiers include:

* Cloud-based AI (full capability)  
* Offline-compatible trust and match logic (client-side fallback)  
* Peer-to-peer sync via mesh protocols (Bluetooth, WiFi Direct, LoRa)  
* Local-only identity & behavior stores (encrypted, auditable)  
* Optional analog fallback: printed match sheets, voice-based coordination

The goal: even when infrastructure falters, Evryn remains a connective tissue \- because trust doesn’t stop mattering when the servers go down.

**3\. The Evryn Protocol vs Platform**  
To preserve integrity and adapt to different needs, we believe we’ll split Evryn into:

* **The Protocol**: A licensed, selectively open framework for trust scoring, identity anchoring, and match logic. This becomes the backbone others can build with \- but not build against.  
* **The Platform**: The flagship interface, AI, and brand. Run by Evryn, Inc., this is where we deliver the full experience, maintain trust standards, and generate revenue.

This separation allows for adaptation and decentralization, without losing control of the thing that makes Evryn work: *a verified, ethical, lived trust graph*.

**4\. Monetization That Works in Both Worlds**  
We’re designing Evryn to thrive in the current system \- but not be bound by it. That means:

* **Pay-per-match** stays core (outcome-based, never attention-based)  
* **Private node licensing** allows aligned communities to use Evryn while supporting the system  
* **Ev tokens** (Ev) can function as either digital credits or barter currency \- collapse-optional, not collapse-only  
* **Peer-to-peer payments** via Stripe Connect now, and eventually Ev-native rails  
* **Reputation-based economic tools**: users can earn Ev through positive behavior, mentorship, or local contribution

In a functioning world, this is a beautiful business. In a fractured one, it’s a functioning trust economy. Either way, we stay aligned with users, not advertisers or manipulation incentives.

**5\. Foundation \+ Inc. Optionality**  
Preferably immediately, but certainly if we ever need to firewall against misaligned power (from within, or without), we would like to stub in from the beginning the ability to instantiate a two-body structure:

* **Evryn Foundation**: Custodian of the Protocol, reputation standards, and long-term mission  
* **Evryn, Inc.**: Revenue-generating interface and primary operator

This duality gives us flexibility \- protecting the mission without preemptively handcuffing capital access.

**6\. Ethical Safeguards Against Power Drift**  
We are under no illusions: an AI system that routes trust at global scale is inherently powerful \- and therefore dangerous if misaligned. To prevent that:

* No *general* agent behavior (Evryn isn’t optimizing for control or growth)  
* No behavioral nudging for engagement or monetization  
* No hidden imperatives \- trust scoring is auditable, logic is reviewable, and all influence is consent-based  
* Kill-switch protocols and human override layers exist at every node

Evryn doesn’t take outside-world *actions*. She facilitates introductions. And only between humans she believes can trust one another.

**7\. Jurisdictional Trust Architecture**

*Trust can’t be promised. It has to be structured.*

Evryn isn’t just governed by internal ethics \- it’s protected by external legal architecture. To ensure that trust memory, behavioral inferences, and match decisions can’t be corrupted, monetized, or quietly exploited, we’re deploying a dual-entity infrastructure model.

Evryn, Inc. (Delaware) retains full control of equity, product development, brand, monetization, and operations.

But the core of what makes Evryn trustworthy—the Privacy-Sovereign Trust Core—is operated by an **independent nonprofit Evryn Foundation headquartered in Switzerland**, under a **mission-locked charter** and governed by a multinational board. Switzerland was chosen because of its nearly unparalleled legal privacy protections, and history of resistance to foreign intrusions. 

This structure ensures that even Evryn’s creators cannot compromise the system’s integrity under pressure.

---

**What Lives Inside the Privacy-Sovereign Trust Core**  
(Operated by the Evryn Foundation – Switzerland)

* Trust graph and behavioral memory  
* Match rationale logs (including rejection logic)  
* Structured psychological profiles and archetype impressions  
* Consent-aware contact, timing, and availability data  
* Rejected match history and sensitive social signals  
* Abuse pattern detection and protective risk models  
* AI inference logs that inform trust-based decisions  
* Encrypted session summaries and evolving reputation scores

All memory and trust processing occurs inside Foundation-controlled infrastructure.

All data remains encrypted and legally protected from foreign jurisdiction.

---

**What Stays Outside**  
(Owned and operated by Evryn Inc. – Delaware)

* Cap table, equity, investor governance  
* Product development and UI/UX  
* Payments, billing systems, customer analytics  
* Session-level LLM integrations (firewalled from trust graph inputs)  
* Marketing, partnerships, and revenue operations

Evryn Inc **does not store or access** any user’s long-term memory, trust fingerprint, or inference logic \- only *outputs* that allow for interaction matching.

---

**Access Is Strictly Scoped**

Evryn Inc accesses the Trust Core **only through narrow, consent-governed APIs**, defined in enforceable Swiss service contracts.

* API responses return *only actionable instructions* to guide Evryn’s behavior  
* No raw behavioral memory, inference data, or profile history is ever exposed  
* All access is logged, rate-limited, and revocable by the Foundation at any time  
* Even the CEO of Evryn Inc cannot access private trust memory \- not by intention, and not by design

This structure ensures that even if the parent company were pressured \- by investors, acquirers, governments, or rogue elements \- it could not betray the foundational promise of Evryn:

You are only known to those you trust.  
And no one \- not even us \- can override that trust without your permission.

This isn't legal theater. It's constitutional infrastructure. A design choice that makes betrayal structurally impossible.

The Privacy-Sovereign Trust Core is sealed from internal operators \- but not from integrity. Every trust-based match, filter, or refusal is logged with explainable signals. These decisions are auditable \- not by users, but by Evryn herself.

If a user believes they’ve been misread, they may request clarity \- but not demand changes. Because Evryn is not a mirror; she is a witness.

Evryn offers insight proportionate to trust. If she believes you’re acting in good faith, she may share how she currently understands you \- not to be debated, but to help you grow.”

If you’re flagged or dangerous, she goes quiet. Not out of spite, but to protect others.

Evryn doesn’t share the playbook. But she will share her truth \- with those she trusts to hear it.

You don’t get to rewrite your story inside her.

But if your story changes \- *she will see it*.

## **Tech Conclusion**

Evryn’s roadmap isn’t just about features. It’s about outcomes: real-world impact, long-lasting connections, and a culture of respect. That’s the vector guiding every decision \- from what we build to how we scale.

Evryn’s technical architecture is intentionally layered and pragmatic \- built to evolve. It reflects the constraints of our present stage, the flexibility we’ll need to grow, and the principles we don’t intend to compromise.

We’ve prioritized modularity, clarity, and trust-first design. Wherever the system changes \- whether that’s in model choice, infrastructure, or governance \- this foundation gives us the scaffolding to adapt without starting over.

This document is not a spec. It’s a blueprint. The specifics will shift. The purpose \- connecting people with care, context, and integrity \- won’t.

# **Key Risks and How We’ll Guard Against Them**

## **Trust Erosion** 

Because trust is Evryn’s bedrock, any breach could be devastating.

**Mitigation:**   
100% aligned incentives, Trust by Design, rigorous data management, user identity verification\*, transparency, willingness to own it when we make a mistake

* In order to be connected to other users, each user must verify their identity in a way that clearly ties their account back to a real person \- likely through a trusted service \- so that Evryn can genuinely vouch for them, and so that bad actors can’t just delete their account and start their malevolence over with a fresh account.

* This idea is introduced to users early, but not required until a little later, to not scare users off with unnecessary complexity too early. When it is later required, it’s presented from the perspective of *“Would you feel comfortable if I connected you to someone I didn’t really know?”* The obvious answer is “no, I wouldn’t.” It flips the perspective: the user realizes **they** wouldn’t want to be matched with unvetted strangers, either. This makes it clear that verification isn’t about mistrusting *you* – it’s about making sure *everyone you meet* is trustworthy. When put that way, users tend to strongly agree that it’s a good idea.

## **Brand/Mission Drift**

**Mitigation:** we’re building everything from the ground up to keep our incentives aligned with only one thing: user success: finding the Highest Resonance for each user. 

Evryn is a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation, legally mission-locked to protect user well-being. The public benefit clause of our Certificate of Incorporation states that the purpose of the Corporation is:

"to foster trusted human connection for our users by developing systems that create high-resonance connections, responsibly steward personal information and insights, and structurally protect emotional wellbeing, informed consent, and relational alignment and trust across every interaction."

## **Category Confusion**

Evryn is pioneering a new category that doesn’t cleanly fit into existing mental models. Early on, people might pigeonhole us as “just a dating app” or “some kind of networking tool,” because those are the closest analogies. This is a risk because miscategorization could turn away potential users (e.g. someone happily married might ignore Evryn thinking it’s only for dating, or an older businessperson might think it’s a youth social app). It also complicates our marketing messaging – we have to educate the market without overwhelming or misleading.

**Mitigation:** Our branding and messaging will emphasize what Evryn is **not** as well as what she is. \*“\*Evryn isn’t a dating app, a networking site, or a gig marketplace \- she’s your personal AI guide; she connects you to “your people” \- those people who are *just the right fit* \- soulmate, crew, cofounder, hookup, plumber \- or just someone to give away an old couch.” We’ll craft a narrative that breaks people out of their single-category mindset, and shows how the fact that she knows you in one domain, makes her better at connecting you in *all* domains.

## **The AI can’t deliver**

**Mitigation:**

* This is all we’re focused on from the time the CTO comes on board.  
* We're selling early adopters on the dream, and letting them know that in order to make it happen, we have to pull together to get people on the platform \- that’s the only way Evryn will have enough data to get good enough to deliver on the promise.

## **“Black Box” decisions** 

users blindly rely on Evryn and over time lose their ability to trust their own judgment.

**Mitigation:** this has been built in from the start, for the user to have ultimate control \- they have to make the ultimate decision on all things; Evryn just takes up the heavy lifting.

## **Invisible Social Credit Scoring**

If users are ranked by some opaque metric, it could lead to a stratified society of the unknowingly privileged vs. penalized. For example, an undisclosed reputation algorithm might quietly stop showing one person to others because of a past behavior, without giving them a chance to improve or understand.

**Mitigation**: Despite the need to maintain *some* opacity to avoid bad actors figuring out how to game the system, Evryn’s default philosophy is to always *do her best to offer people connections* \- in ways that are helpful and not harmful, and to always give people an opportunity for redemption, if it’s genuine. Evryn will not maintain blacklists. Evryn’s opinion of each user will be nuanced, multidimensional, and dynamic. Any filtering (like removing abusive actors) should be fair, and transparent \- **but transparent only in direct proportion to the extent that Evryn believes she can trust the user**. Virtually all prioritization or de-prioritization is user-match specific, not global. However, if Evryn’s opinion of someone’s character is causing them to be more broadly de-prioritized – say, due to reports of harassment – she will do her best to give them a chance to explain or improve themselves, before resorting to silently ghosting them in the system. In short, Evryn will filter out bad behavior (to keep the community safe) but **won’t judge human worth with a single score** that users can neither see nor contest.

## **AI Manipulation or “Social Engineering”** 

Because Evryn’s AI will learn what makes people tick emotionally, she would have the ability to *manipulate* users’ choices or beliefs over time.

**Mitigation:**

* The team first of all recognizes that there’s no such thing as “neutral”. Evryn is making evaluations about connections, and therefore must have a perspective of what makes one connection “better” than another. To fail to recognize that, would be to introduce biases in the name of “neutrality”. And so we will be ever vigilant in regard to what values we are injecting.  
* Having said that, the team’s stance is that Evryn is a **matchmaker and guide, not a puppet master**. Evryn should **suggest, not push** – recommendations will be framed as Evryn’s *personal opinion,* rather than directives. Importantly, Evryn will endeavor to **never intentionally bias matches based on ideology or creed** – e.g. it shouldn’t decide you need more friends of a certain political belief and then only show those, or try to “fix” someone’s views by social exposure.  
* On the other hand, if a user *wants* to grow, Evryn will *absolutely* facilitate that. Users will also have control over how adventurous or familiar they want their connections to be, via conversations they have with Evryn. This ensures users can opt *in* to being challenged or stick to comfort for a while, rather than Evryn unilaterally deciding how to shape their social world.  
* And the most powerful mitigation we have at our disposal is simply structurally aligning our incentives to user success \- as defined by each user.

## **Mass Surveillance & Privacy Erosion**

By its nature, Evryn will collect intimate personal data (deep desires, fears, beliefs, preferences, social graphs, conversational patterns), and for Evryn’s trust model to work and be enduring, users must be verified to their real-world identity. In a dystopic turn, this data could be misused – either by Evryn itself or by third parties. Users might believe their information is private, but behind the scenes every interaction could be logged and analyzed, creating a **panopticon of relationships, as well as the inner world of users**.

**Mitigation:** Privacy is a top design principle. **Data minimization** is one strategy – Evryn will aim to store only what is necessary for making connections, and purge anything it doesn’t need, over time. Evryn will also take every reasonable measure to protect, encrypt, and anonymize data, at every turn. Evryn will have an **absolutely no data sales** policy – user data won’t be treated as a commodity to sell to marketers, period. Transparency features will let users know exactly who can see what information, and give them the power to delete their data entirely from the system at any time. When that happens, Evryn will maintain her *personal opinion* of the user \- as anyone who knows anyone does \- so that bad actors can’t just wipe Evryn’s memory of them and then continue on with their bad behavior, but all of the private user information will be permanently deleted.

## **“Addiction Machine” Engagement Loops**

We’ve built from the ground up to avoid this, and will continue to do so.

## **Monetization Corrupting the Mission**

We’ve built from the ground up to avoid this, and will continue to do so.

## **Exploitation and Abuse of the System** 

We’ve built from the ground up to avoid this, and will continue to do so. Our key lever here is having everything come through Evryn. As far as we can tell, this is better than *anything* out there, in terms of firewalling our users from harm. And this is also why, even though it causes difficulty to hold this line, Evryn cannot connect unverified users. Letting unverified users into such a trust-based space introduces so many vectors for abuse. We’d be playing perpetual whack-a-mole with bad actors. But by not letting them past the gates at all, we almost entirely avoid that. Evryn will also employ **AI to detect AI** – scanning for deepfakes, linguistic patterns, and other markers of inauthenticity, with proactive flagging and removal.

## **Replacing Real Relationships**

Again, we’ve built from the ground up to avoid this. Evryn also has specific safeguards in place, in case this starts to develop, to gently move the user off reliance on her, and into real relationships.

## **Bias Lock-In (Reinforcing Inequality)**

If the underlying data or algorithms have bias, Evryn could systematically favor certain groups – and downrank marginalized individuals. In effect, she could **entrench social inequalities** by baking them into the matching engine. This would create a dystopia where Evryn becomes an exclusive club for the already privileged.

**Mitigations:** To be clear: Evryn is solidly in the game of *discrimination* \- “I believe this person would be better for you than that person”. That’s *what* she does. This is a feature \- not a bug. What we want to be vigilant against is *unjust* discrimination \- discrimination that leaks into Evryn’s thinking from the overall culture, discrimination that makes Evryn favor someone for reasons that don’t help the users she’s connecting, but only reinforce what’s broken about our culture. The team plans explicit measures to **test for unjust bias** in Evryn’s outcomes. We will continuously monitor matching results across demographics to see if any group is getting systematically poorer matches or fewer opportunities. We will then *first seek to understand what the actual mechanisms and drivers are that is causing this to take place*, before adjusting algorithms accordingly (for example a certain group may like or dislike certain things, and that will affect their outcomes; we have no desire to tell that group that they can’t have what they want, just because it doesn’t create the outcomes that *we* deem “best”). Training data for Evryn’s AI will be curated for diversity, to avoid an echo chamber of the status quo. Additionally, through her conversations with users, Evryn will ultimately always give *each user* control over what they consider a “good” match, so the definition of success isn’t one-size-fits-all from the system’s perspective. **We recognize that giving users the freedom to choose their own paths *will* create asymmetrical results.** We just want to make sure that *we* aren’t unfairly biasing the results. The overarching goal is for Evryn to **open the social playing field, not reinforce existing hierarchies, but also not to force our own ideal of “level”**.

# **Long View**

As it stands now, we’re not heading toward a more connected world.

We’re heading toward a world of *frictionless isolation*.

A world where computer systems remember everything about you \- but not usually for *your* benefit.

Where you can scroll endlessly, or talk to a machine all day, and still feel utterly alone.

In the years ahead, so many platforms will get smarter, faster, better.

But ‘better’ at doing things in the broken way they’ve always done them \- the way that’s gotten us all feeling so disconnected.

And better at simulating presence, without ever offering it.

Evryn isn’t here to give you short-term dopamine hits and leave you exhausted.

And she isn’t here to simulate anything.

She’s here to *reveal* what’s already real: to remind you that there are people out there \- right now \- who would change your life…if only you could meet them.

That no matter where you’ve found yourself, your story’s just beginning.

That connection is not a lost art. It’s just been…

Buried

Evryn is here to surface what matters.

And to bring you the kind of connection that doesn’t just feel good for a moment…

…but reshapes what your life becomes.

Evryn will get smarter \- and more attuned to *what matters* \- with every connection she midwives. Competing platforms, especially if they remain focused on surface-level data, will have a hard time catching up to that depth of relational insight. It’s a moat built not just on AI, but on accumulated *human outcomes* that only Evryn has visibility into.

Moreover, as Evryn grows, the **network effect** kicks in on multiple levels. Our pool of potential connections broadens and diversifies, which improves matches for everyone. Someone seeking a niche interest or rare type of collaborator might struggle on a smaller or more siloed platform, but find their “needle in a haystack” on Evryn once we have scale.

And given that we built this from the ground up to be a trust-based economy in a world where everyone else just wants to exploit you for profit, Evryn will eventually become the premier trust broker in the world.

Evryn’s brand will become synonymous with trusted, meaningful connection. Long-term, **Evryn’s ultimate leverage** will be in owning the trust layer of human connection on the internet.

And just as distrust is contagious, so is trust. So as Evryn grows, this new ethos will permeate the culture at large, reweaving the fabric of society. Healing it. She will create a world where the default is that relationships are *all* of the highest quality, and people can be trusted \- because they are vetted through a reliable trust broker.

Mental health will skyrocket \- connection is vitally important for happy, healthy people

Divorce will plummet, family stability will soar, outcomes for children will improve drastically.

Social groups will become more aligned, harmonious \- and connected. Everyone will have a robust network of connections. People will become better, more fulfilled versions of themselves, *and* will have a much more robust safety net in hard times.

Job fit \- and thereby satisfaction *and* productivity \- will skyrocket: people will be able to be matched with the best employers for them: the employer who can best employ their specific skills, but also the one they would most enjoy working at.

Money won’t be necessary in more and more situations, as Evryn does what money was always meant to do, but does rather poorly: vouch for your past contributions to society, and to let you carry forward the value you deliver today, to your relationships tomorrow.

When connections consistently feel **meaningful and serendipitous**, people start to regain a sense of *trust* in life’s possibilities \- life feels “meant to be”.

We’re building a world where life feels more meaningful, belonging is effortless, relationships are richer and more genuine, and opportunity is democratized through connection. A world with happier individuals, stronger families, stronger communities, and a society that values genuine human connection over arbitrary status, where genuine character becomes currency. Talent, passion, kindness, and other intrinsic qualities get recognized and matched to opportunity via Evryn, even if those individuals lack traditional capital \- including social capital. Evryn’s world is one where community and connection are orchestrated intelligently, leading to greater and greater human flourishing, the world over.

# **Appendix: Terms of Service** {#appendix:-terms-of-service}

### **Trust Mirror (User-Initiated Inquiry)**

Users may request Evryn’s perspective on individuals they already know. When this occurs, Evryn may share limited subjective impressions based on internal trust signals, historical match feedback, or behavioral patterns \- without disclosing personal data or specific reports.

All such responses are:

* Expressed as opinion, not fact  
* Centered on platform alignment and user safety  
* Non-actionable by third parties (not intended as character judgments)

Evryn does not disclose private information, but may indicate whether a match would have been offered. For example:

“I wouldn’t have introduced the two of you.”

These reflections are private, user-initiated, and intended only to support relational clarity and protection.

**Right to Withhold Matching.**  
 “Participation in the referral program does not guarantee matching. If Evryn determines a user has engaged in abusive, manipulative, or bad-faith behavior, Evryn reserves the right to withhold rewards or limit access to the platform.”

**No Guaranteed Access or Earnings.**  
 “Evryn is a curated environment. All participation is subject to ongoing trust evaluation. Access is not guaranteed and may be limited or revoked at Evryn’s discretion.”

**Referral Rewards Are Conditional.**  
 “Referral rewards are discretionary and contingent on the referred user becoming a paying customer. Evryn reserves the right to determine when a referral is valid and when a reward is appropriate.”

**Evryn Credit Is Not Cash.**  
 “Evryn Credit has no cash value, is not transferable, and may only be used within the platform.”

### **User-to-User Payments & Post-Match Transactions**

Evryn may facilitate payments between users for services, collaboration, or appreciation following a successful introduction. These payments are processed via third-party payment infrastructure (e.g., Stripe Connect) and are initiated at the discretion of the users involved.

Evryn is not a party to any transaction, agreement, contract, or exchange of services between users. Evryn does not set prices, guarantee outcomes, or assume responsibility for work completed after a match. All post-match collaboration is at the sole discretion and risk of the users involved.

By participating in user-to-user payments, you acknowledge:

* All service-related agreements are solely between you and the other user.  
* Evryn facilitates payments for convenience only, and does not act as an employer, agent, contractor, or platform operator on behalf of either party.  
* Evryn does not mediate or adjudicate disputes arising from post-match collaboration.

However, Evryn may observe behavior following a match \- including communication patterns, payment fulfillment, and dispute resolution \- and may incorporate this information into the platform’s internal trust systems. Users who demonstrate patterns of dishonest, harmful, or disruptive behavior may experience reduced access to new matches, or removal from the platform entirely.

Use of Evryn’s post-match payment facilitation tools is opt-in and subject to these terms. Evryn may refuse to process transactions or restrict access to payment features at its sole discretion if misuse, fraud, or safety concerns are detected.

### **StartEngine & Investment Invitations**

Evryn’s investment opportunities are offered through StartEngine under Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF). These opportunities are:

* **Proactively introduced, but never pressured** – Evryn may offer ownership invitations during natural moments in the user journey, especially when belief is high or timing is resonant.  
* **Optional and non-transactional** – users may access all features of the platform without investing.  
* **Consistently available** – investment access is never gated behind emotional state, usage tier, or urgency mechanics.

Evryn may use emotional or behavioral cues to **time** these invitations thoughtfully. When this occurs:

* Users are clearly informed (via this document and our Privacy Policy) that invitations may reflect Evryn’s sense of readiness, alignment, or resonance.  
* Participation remains opt-in, and users may opt out of future investment prompts at any time.

This framing ensures compliance with:

* **Reg CF and SEC** guidelines (avoiding coercion, exclusivity, or misrepresentation),  
* **GDPR/CCPA** profiling laws (with full disclosure and control),  
* **FTC standards** (no manipulation, urgency, or baiting).

In short: investing in Evryn is framed as a way to co-create \- not as a purchase, pitch, or pressure play. If users believe in what she’s becoming, ownership is quietly available.

# **Appendix: Tools & Svcs for BizOps \- Compact**

These are the Tools & Services we’re either already using, or we’ve (at least tentatively) chosen going forward, as of September, 2025\. Much of this was put together in May, so some things on here are aging. See the older long version of this document in the Notion Vault for runners-up and longer rationale.

## **Legal & Incorporation**

* **Clerky** – Platform to automate forming a Delaware C-Corp and handle standard startup legal paperwork (incorporation, stock issuance, bylaws, SAFE, Registered Agent, etc.).

* **Legal Counsel** – Fenwick & West.

## **Trademark & IP Protection**

* **LegalZoom** – Online legal service used to file and monitor the trademark for “Evryn,” providing an affordable alternative to hiring an IP attorney.

## **Finance & Accounting Systems**

* **Rho (Banking)** – Online startup-focused banking platform chosen for Evryn’s business bank account (no-fee, digital checking with startup perks).

* **QuickBooks Online** – The primary accounting software for bookkeeping and financial records, selected for its ubiquity and strong integrations (standard for startups).

* **Finmark** – Financial planning and modeling tool (now part of BILL) planned for use in forecasting runway, budgets, and scenario analysis, integrating actuals from QuickBooks.

* **Gusto (Payroll)** – Payroll service selected to handle employee and contractor pay once the team grows (integrates with QuickBooks and designed for small businesses).

* **Deel** – International hiring \- mostly works for EOR, but can work for contractors, if contract structure is simple enough

* **Stripe** \- payment processing within the product (with Stripe Connect for peer-to-peer payments)

* **Google Sheets (Cap Table)** – A spreadsheet is being used to manage the equity cap table in the early stage, postponing the need for paid cap-table software until more investors/employees join.

## **Fundraising & Equity Crowdfunding**

* **StartEngine** – Equity crowdfunding platform selected for Evryn’s planned fundraising campaign, chosen for its large investor community and features (e.g. secondary trading for investors).

* **DocSend** – a tool for sending pitch decks and documents with tracking; a future tool to use once investor outreach begins. DocSend will allow Justin to share his deck with angels or VCs and see if and when they read it, how much time they spend on slides, etc.

## **Website, Domains & Hosting**

* **Namecheap** – Domain registrar used for securing all Evryn domain names (e.g. [evryn.ai](http://evryn.ai), .net, .org), also providing simple web hosting for the initial low-traffic landing page, as well as a domain broker that is currently securing acquisition of [evryn.com](http://evryn.com).

* **Webflow** – Website design and hosting platform selected to build Evryn’s main marketing site, allowing a scalable, no-code, visually rich website that can grow with the startup’s needs.

* **Google Analytics** \- to track website traffic.

* **Cloudflare Pages / Vercel / VPS** – *Planned (scale-up option).* These developer-oriented hosting solutions were mentioned as contingency plans for scaling.

* **DropCatch/NameJet (Domain Backorder)** – *in plan t*o secure [*evryn.com*](http://evryn.com), tools like this were mentioned for backordering the domain in case it expires

* **WHOIS/DomainIQ/Wayback Machine** – used to investigate [evryn.com](http://evryn.com)’s history and ownership, trying to gauge if it was recently sold or might be available.

## **Customer Management**

* **Mailchimp** – Email marketing service used to capture leads and send pre-launch newsletters/drip campaigns, taking advantage of its free tier and ease of use for early audience building.

* **ConvertKit** – *Recommended for early email capture.* ConvertKit is an email marketing platform popular with creators/startups. It offers up to 1,000 subscribers free and is *“email-first”* – great for capturing emails and sending sequences.

* **HubSpot CRM** – Customer relationship management system planned for later use to track contacts and engagement at scale (to be adopted once user sign-ups and investor relations grow complex \- **though it’s looking more like HubSpot Free may be simple enough to be our first choice from the beginning**).

* **Zendesk** – Customer support ticketing system earmarked for later use to handle support inquiries at scale; not deployed initially since Evryn will start with an AI-driven support approach, but ready to roll out as user support needs increase.

* **Discord** – Community platform planned for Evryn’s user base, where early users and supporters will gather in a Discord server to engage with the brand and each other (a free, tech-community-friendly option).

* **iDenfy** – Customer identity verification. Chosen for a few reasons: Comes up near the top of most lists. It’s international \- 200 countries & territories; only charges for successful IDs (boasts 3x faster and 70% cheaper), instant machine verification, plus 3-minute human double-verification. Can work for businesses (if we go that route). Lots of integrations. And if customers know the name of the service we’re using, this sounds much more friendly \- some of these sound daunting and dystopian. Jumio is maybe even a strong contender long-term, but doesn’t make it easy for us to ramp in at MVP stage.

## **Project Management & Documentation**

* **ClickUp** – All-in-one project management hub chosen to organize tasks, projects, and dashboards across the team, serving as the “nerve center” for coordinating work in one place.

* **Slack** – Internal communication tool selected for team collaboration, used for real-time messaging and updates among team members (e.g. receiving notifications from ClickUp into Slack).

* **Notion** – Collaborative workspace used for structured ideation and note-taking; a “thinking space” where Justin drafts ideas and plans, complementing ClickUp’s task-focused workflow.

* **Google Drive (Docs & Sheets)** – Cloud storage and document editing suite (Google Docs/Sheets) used for creating and storing content, with plans to integrate or link these files into ClickUp for central visibility.

* **Airtable** – Airtable has been on the table several times \- seems useful but at the moment, we don’t have a specific home for it.

## **Product Analytics**

* **Amplitude** – Product analytics service planned for future implementation to track user behavior and engagement in the app, enabling detailed funnel analysis once Evryn has live users (deferred until a beta is running).

## **Recruitment & Freelance Platforms**

* **Y Combinator Co-founder Matching** – YC’s matchmaking platform for entrepreneurs, utilized to find a technical co-founder (high-priority search channel given YC’s large startup founder network).

* **CoFoundersLab** – Online co-founder matchmaking platform (open to all) used to seek out potential technical or design co-founders for Evryn.

* **Pioneer.app** – Startup community and competition platform tapped as another avenue to pitch Evryn and connect with ambitious entrepreneurs who might join as co-founders.

* **AngelList Talent** – has a job listing and founder-finding aspect. AngelList (now also Wellfound) is being considered for both co-founders and finding early hires.

* **Indie Hackers & FoundersList** – These communities are grassroots networks of startup enthusiasts and founders. Indie Hackers, in particular, has forums and meetup events where connecting with a co-founder is possible.

* **LinkedIn** – Professional networking site leveraged for recruiting key team members (e.g. a crowdfunding campaign manager or growth marketer) by searching and reaching out to candidates with relevant experience.

* [**Indie.vc**](http://Indie.vc) **Network** – A community of startup folks (from the [Indie.vc](http://Indie.vc) alumni network) utilized to find talent for roles like the fundraising campaign manager via personal connections and forums.

* **Upwork** – Freelance marketplace used to contract **skilled professionals** for short-term work; for example, hiring developers to build an MVP or UI/UX designers for the app on a project basis.
