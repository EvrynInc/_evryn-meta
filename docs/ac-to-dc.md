This file contained AC→DC communication rounds 1-7 for the LangGraph build phase. All content has been absorbed into persistent docs. Mailbox communication now lives in the relevant repo:

- `evryn-team-agents/docs/ac-to-dc.md`
- `evryn-team-agents/docs/dc-to-ac.md`

See `_evryn-meta/CLAUDE.md` → "AC/DC Communication Protocol" for the current pattern.
