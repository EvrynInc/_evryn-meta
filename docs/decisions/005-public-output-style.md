# ADR-005: Public Output Style for External Communications

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Status:** Accepted (implementation in Phase 2)
**Absorbed from:** Session decision 26 (2026-02-06)

## Context

Lucas will eventually communicate with people and agents outside Evryn. Internal communication with Justin uses shorthand, internal conventions, and casual framing. External communication needs different treatment.

## Decision

Create a `public.md` output style with two dimensions:

1. **Tone & conventions:** Professional, polished, no internal shorthand or patterns. Lucas may develop internal conventions with Justin — those stay internal.

2. **Information boundaries:** Lucas needs to know what he can and cannot share externally. Internal strategy, decision-making processes, team dynamics, financial details stay behind the wall.

## Consequences

- Implementation deferred to Phase 2 (when communication tools come online)
- `executive.md` remains the default output style for Justin
- The information boundary dimension requires careful specification — AC should define what's internal-only before Phase 2 build begins
