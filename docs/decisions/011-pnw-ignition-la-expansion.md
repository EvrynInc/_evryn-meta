# ADR-011: Pacific Northwest Ignition, LA Expansion

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision by:** Justin + AC

## Context

The original Master Plan (v2.3) assumed an LA-first launch strategy — the film industry's densest community, highest volume of potential users, and Justin's second-gen network (~78K contacts via ~40 highly-connected film people). The entire GTM, competitive analysis, and growth model were built around "LA Film Ecosystem" as the ignition point.

As we moved from planning to execution, the reality shifted:

- **The film industry is contracting** — 41K LA jobs lost, production fleeing to other states and countries, all four major union contracts expiring mid-2026. LA's dominance as the center of film is weakening. Putting everything into an LA launch carries real concentration risk.
- **Mark (pilot gatekeeper) is in Seattle.** The person who actually said yes and is ready to go is PNW-based.
- **Megan Griffiths (film advisor) is in Seattle.** Her network of indie producers, department heads, and casting people — all potential next gatekeepers — is PNW-rooted.
- **Justin's direct contacts are primarily Seattle.** ~600-700 film/theatre/adjacent contacts, mostly PNW. Plus broad Seattle connections from nearly a decade in the fitness/wellness industry.
- **The warmest paths to gatekeepers #2 and #3 run through Seattle**, not LA.
- **Seattle has its own acute need** — the "Seattle Freeze" and loneliness epidemic make Evryn's positioning especially resonant locally.

Meanwhile, nothing about the LA opportunity has disappeared — it's still the densest film market, still the long-term target, and Justin/Mark/Megan all have LA contacts. The question was sequencing, not destination.

## Decision

**Launch in the Pacific Northwest (Seattle). Expand to LA.**

- Focus density efforts where the warm paths are (Seattle)
- Let growth spread wherever it spreads — no subscription churn means users in other cities just wait for matches
- Expand to LA when proof of concept is in hand and connections are warm
- Don't force a choice — this is sequencing, not exclusion

**LA is the expansion target, not a fallback.** The reasons the film industry is a good ignition point (tight-knit, high-need, collaborative) are about the *industry*, not the city. Seattle proves the model; LA scales it.

## Rationale

- **Concentration risk.** If LA film contracts further, a PNW-first strategy means we haven't bet everything on one market.
- **You launch where your pilot is.** Mark isn't theoretical — he's ready. Building for a hypothetical LA gatekeeper while a real Seattle gatekeeper is waiting would be strategically backwards.
- **Warm paths beat cold pitches.** Megan can open doors to Seattle gatekeepers now. LA gatekeepers are reachable but require proof of concept first.
- **No downside to this sequencing.** Users who find Evryn from other cities simply get told "we haven't officially launched in your area yet" and get surprised later when a match materializes. Zero churn.

## Impact

- Hub, GTM spoke, and Trusted Partner Briefing all updated from LA-first to PNW-first with LA expansion
- SIFF (Seattle, mid-May) replaces Sundance/SXSW as inaugural event target
- Gatekeeper targeting resequenced: Seattle warm paths first, LA via introductions
- Market sizing frameworks unchanged — LA Film Ecosystem remains the first major market in projections

## What This Doesn't Change

- Film industry as the ignition vertical
- The wave strategy
- The gatekeeper model
- LA as the primary expansion target
- The long-term vision of cross-domain, cross-geography growth
