## What's NOT Done — GTM Spoke Edits

The approved plan (also saved at `C:\Users\Justin\.claude\plans\serene-painting-lantern.md`) has the full detail. Summary of edits to `docs/hub/gtm-and-growth.md`:

### Edit 1: Phase-annotate existing sections (light edits throughout)
Add build phase context throughout the doc. Use absolute references (v0.2, v0.3, v0.4, v1.0).

**Build phase reference:**
- v0.2 "Gatekeeper's Inbox" — CURRENT. Email triage for Mark. One gatekeeper, Justin approves all outbound.
- v0.3 "Cast-off Outreach + Onboarding" — ~2 weeks post-MVP. Reach cast-offs. CRM. Expanded onboarding.
- v0.4 "Wizard-of-Oz Matching" — Semi-automated matching with human oversight.
- v1.0 "Full Matching" — Many-to-many matching engine.

**Sections to annotate:**
- Strategic Context: Add sentence noting the build stage sequence
- Top-Down Gatekeeper: v0.2 activates for one gatekeeper. v0.3 activates cast-off outreach. Multiple gatekeepers after Mark stable.
- Bottom-Up Whisper Cascade: Growth strategy, not a build phase. Formalized mechanisms (invite system, referral tracking, credit bonuses) require member interface — v0.4+. Currently dormant as formalized channel.
- Wave Strategy: v0.4+ thinking — requires matching capability.
- Cast-Off Outreach: Explicitly label as v0.3. Note time-sensitivity (~200/day).
- Growth Mechanics: Referral Mechanics = v0.4+. Evangelist Story Loops = v0.4+. Conversational growth embedding = activates with member interface.
- Segment-to-Avatar Mapping: Film Creators & Crews is v0.2-v0.3 segment. All others are post-LA-film expansion.

### Edit 2: Elevate "industry in transition"
Move the "industry in transition" bullet out of the LA Film section into its own subsection. Add strategic implications:
- Types of connections shifting (traditional collab → career transition)
- Gatekeeper inbound may change character
- Wave strategy may need adaptation
- Link to `docs/research/film-industry-ai-disruption-v1.md`

Key data points from research:
- LA lost 41,000 film/TV jobs in 3 years (25% of workforce)
- 204,000 entertainment jobs projected displaced by 2026
- Entry-level pipeline is broken (AI absorbed first-rung tasks)
- All 4 major union contracts expire May-July 2026
- LA production down 16.1% in 2025, geographic shift accelerating
- Studios offering 5-year contracts in exchange for $100M health plan lifeline

### Edit 3: Build out Launch Readiness Discipline
Currently a placeholder. Pull principles from Master Plan, update for AI-first reality.

**Updated sacred launch conditions (v0.2 pilot):**
1. Evryn's triage judgment validated against Mark's own sorting (validation period complete)
2. Legal coverage in place (Fenwick Terms cover gatekeeper relationship)
3. Error handling and monitoring operational (alerts, recovery, no silent failures)
4. Justin confident in Evryn's tone and judgment quality

**Updated scope flex triggers:**
- Compression: Mark not engaging → simplify delivery, reduce frequency. AI costs high → optimize prompts, reduce scope. Legal blockers → email-only, defer cast-off outreach.
- Expansion: Mark trusts early → accelerate to Step 4. Cast-off response strong → begin second gatekeeper search. Classification sharp → reduce Justin's approval gate.

**Preserve principle:** "The experience of meeting Evryn never gets compromised."

**Film industry seasonal timing (from Master Plan, still relevant):**
- Sundance: January
- Pilot Season: January-March
- SXSW, film school showcases: Spring
- Summer shoots: staffing in late spring
- Dead week between Christmas and New Year: unique window

### Edit 4: Add Outreach Playbook section (NEW)
Integrate modernized content from Master Plan lines 1305-1337. Phase-annotated (mostly v0.3+).

**Sections:**
- PR: Niche outlets, tech writers covering social innovation, LA press ("Hollywood connector AI"), podcasts. Press hooks for 2026: AI trust in an age of deepfakes, gatekeeper model, film industry disruption angle. Press "trigger points" — escalate to larger outlets when milestones hit.
- Community: Film festivals (Austin, Sundance, SXSW — presence, fliers, hosted mixers), film school networks, niche sites (NoFilmSchool), forums (Reddit, Facebook groups, Discord).
- Influencer: Identify industry voices within film community.
- Ad spend: Post-traction, not launch strategy. Targeted story-driven ads. Video/animation explaining Evryn. Paid partnerships (niche newsletters, YouTube).

### Edit 5: Clear Master Plan line references
- Lines 921-1006 (launch timeline): Integrate film industry seasonal timing into wave strategy or outreach. Remove reference.
- Lines 1305-1337 (outreach): Absorbed into Outreach Playbook. Remove reference.
- Lines 1012-1127 (department plans): Truly obsolete (human team). Remove entirely.
- Lines 1568-1670 (competitive SWOT): Replace Notion reference with link to `docs/research/competitive-landscape-v1.md`. Remove line reference.

### Edit 6: Competitive Landscape refresh
Replace current table with updated version from research. Key updates:
- Add Amata, Overtone, Known, Sitch to dating
- Add Osmos to professional
- Update incumbent AI features (Bumble AI photo feedback, Tinder Chemistry, Hinge AI algorithm)
- Note Hinge CEO departure as industry signal
- Replace Notion Deep Research reference with link to new report
- Keep Infrastructure Licensing subsection (still strategic)

### Edit 7: Final consistency pass
- Cross-check phase refs against BUILD-EVRYN-MVP.md
- Verify no contradictions with hub (roadmap.md GTM paragraph)
- Verify gatekeeper framing with detail/gatekeeper-approach.md
- Verify business model refs with business-model.md

## Research Report Key Findings (for reference during edits)

### Film Industry (docs/research/film-industry-ai-disruption-v1.md)
- Sora 2 + Runway Gen-4 solved jitter problem. Professional adoption year.
- 41K LA jobs lost. 204K projected displaced. 17K+ slashed in 2025 alone.
- Entry-level pipeline broken — compositing, rotoscoping, rough edits absorbed by AI.
- All union contracts expire mid-2026 (SAG-AFTRA June 30, DGA June 30, WGA May 1, IATSE July 31)
- Studios offering 5-year contracts (vs 3-year) for $100M health plan money — locks in AI provisions longer
- LA production down: 22.4% Q1 2025, 16.1% full-year. Only 24/87 scripted projects filmed partly in LA.
- New roles emerging: AI supervisors, pipeline integrators, prompt engineers for film

### Competitive Landscape (docs/research/competitive-landscape-v1.md)
- Overtone: Hinge CEO left to build AI+voice dating. Match Group backing. HIGH WATCH.
- Amata: Closest UX competitor. AI matchmaker, no swiping, $20/match. Dating-only, thin trust. $6M funding.
- Osmos: Professional networking. 1 curated match/week. 3K+ C-level execs. Double opt-in. Validates model.
- Lunchclub: 100+ countries, 10M+ introductions. Goal-based professional matching.
- Incumbents (Bumble, Tinder, Hinge): Using AI to optimize swipe model, not replace it.
- LinkedIn: AI job search, career path, cross-language. Not building introductions.
- Stage 32: 1M+ film creatives. No AI matchmaking. Education + networking hybrid.
- No one is cross-domain. No one has compounding trust graph. No one does trust-based pricing.
- "The market is moving toward Evryn's model" — but no one is building exactly what Evryn is building.

## Execution Approach for GTM Spoke

This is a source-of-truth document — requires Justin's approval for edits. Plan is to do a full rewrite of the file (per CLAUDE.md preference for full writes over incremental edits on shorter files), present to Justin for review, then commit+push.

The GTM spoke is 151 lines currently. With additions (outreach playbook, expanded launch readiness, industry transition subsection), it'll grow to approximately 250-300 lines. Still manageable as a full write.
