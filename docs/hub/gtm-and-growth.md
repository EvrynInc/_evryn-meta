## Strategic Context (as of Feb 2026)

The Master Plan's GTM was written assuming a traditional startup with a human tech team — expensive burn rate, need for significant funding before launch, pressure for a big coordinated launch to overcome the cold-start problem. The AI-first pivot fundamentally changes this calculus:

- **Dramatically lower burn.** With Justin as sole human operator building primarily with AI (Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK), monthly costs are a fraction of what a human engineering team would require. This removes the urgency to raise large rounds before proving the model.
- **Organic launch becomes viable.** Lower burn means Evryn can grow at the pace trust requires — no need to force premature scale to justify headcount or runway.
- **Gatekeeper strategy reduces cold-start pressure.** Each gatekeeper partnership brings ~200 potential users/day organically. Even one active gatekeeper generates meaningful network density without a marketing blitz.
- **But gatekeepers are hard to reach.** Justin has real inroads (Mark is the pilot, and there are warm paths to others), but most gatekeepers will treat Evryn's pitch as part of their own slush pile. The bottom-up whisper cascade strategy is still essential — it builds the social proof and user base that makes gatekeepers take notice.

**Bottom line:** The strategic direction below is correct — LA film first, wave strategy, whisper cascade, quality over quantity. What's evolved is the *urgency and scale assumptions*. Evryn can afford to grow more deliberately, prove the model at small scale, and let traction speak for itself.

**Build phases and GTM alignment:**
- **v0.2 "Gatekeeper's Inbox"** — Mark live, triage running, user records accumulating. GTM is one gatekeeper proving the model.
- **v0.3 "The Broker"** — Web app + matching + payments + cast-off outreach. GTM shifts: cast-offs become the acquisition channel (~200 new users/day from Mark alone), first revenue flows, whisper cascade begins organically.
- **v0.4 "Scale"** — Second gatekeeper, publisher module, agents. GTM widens: wave strategy activates across multiple gatekeeper channels, proactive outreach, Lucas manages operations.

## LA Film Industry as Ignition Point

The plan targets Los Angeles film industry first because:
- Highest need for quality introductions — everyone is either clamoring for attention they can't get or drowning in attention they don't want
- Highly collaborative — no one makes a movie alone — mixing business, creative, social, romantic, and big money
- Very tight-knit — each new user knows 300-5,000 qualified leads
- Current tools are woefully inadequate (Facebook threads, job boards, DM chains, referral lists)
- Justin's extensive reach (78,000+ second-gen contacts)
- Capturing LA film opens up: rest of LA (everyone is connected to film), rest of the film industry globally, and the entertainment industry megaphone
- **Follow-through as differentiator:** In the film industry, introductions aren't enough — follow-through matters. By facilitating payments and re-engagements, Evryn becomes not just the introducer, but the connective tissue for real working relationships. This is a core differentiator at launch.

### An Industry in Transition

The film industry is contracting faster than most people realize, and AI is accelerating the shift. This makes Evryn *more* urgent, not less — and changes *what kinds of connections* people need.

**The numbers:** LA County has lost 41,000 film and TV jobs — a quarter of its entertainment workforce — in three years. 204,000 entertainment jobs are projected displaced. LA on-location filming dropped 22.4% in Q1 2025 and 16.1% for the full year. Only 24 of 87 scripted projects filmed even partly in LA. Production is fleeing to Georgia, New Mexico, the UK, and Canada.

**AI is the accelerant.** 2026 is the year of professional AI video adoption. Sora 2, Runway Gen-4.5, Kling 3.0, and Google Veo 3.1 are producing broadcast-quality output. Entry-level jobs — compositing, rotoscoping, rough edits — are being absorbed by AI tools, breaking the traditional career ladder at the bottom rungs. New roles are emerging (AI supervisors, pipeline integrators, prompt engineers for film), but the transition is painful and disorienting.

**All four major union contracts expire mid-2026** — SAG-AFTRA (June 30), DGA (June 30), WGA (May 1), IATSE (July 31). Studios are offering 5-year contracts (vs. 3-year) with a $100M health plan lifeline in exchange for longer terms — which would lock in whatever AI protections are negotiated for half a decade while AI capabilities evolve rapidly. The negotiations will dominate industry conversation from May through July. Film professionals will be anxious, and attention will be focused on AI's role in their future.

**What this means for Evryn:**
1. **The types of connections people need are shifting.** Traditional film collaboration ("find me a DP") is still needed but declining. Career transition connections ("I'm a VFX artist — what else can I do?"), cross-industry introductions ("my film skills transfer to gaming/advertising/tech"), and AI-related connections ("who can teach me AI pipeline integration?") are growing. Evryn should serve both needs.
2. **Gatekeepers may get different inbound.** As the industry contracts, gatekeepers like Mark may receive more desperate or transition-oriented outreach alongside traditional pitches. Evryn's triage needs to account for this — someone who isn't a fit for Mark's film projects might be a perfect Evryn user for other connection types.
3. **The wave strategy may need adaptation.** Below-the-line crew are shrinking. New roles (AI supervisors, pipeline integrators) may create new wave paths.
4. **Trust in AI is actively being eroded.** The Seedance 2.0 copyright battle — where ByteDance's AI video tool generated copyrighted characters within days of launch, triggering cease-and-desist letters from Disney, Paramount, Netflix, Warner Bros., and Sony — has made "AI" a loaded word in the film industry. Evryn is not an AI video tool — she's a trusted connector who happens to be AI-powered. But film professionals angry about AI displacing their colleagues may reflexively distrust *any* AI system. Evryn's approach should lead with trust, relationship, and human outcomes — not with "AI" as a feature.
5. **The contract negotiation window (May-July 2026) overlaps with v0.3's target timeline.** This is both sensitive and opportune — a moment when trusted connections matter most.

## Two Parallel Growth Channels

### Top-Down: Gatekeeper Partnerships

High-volume connectors (like Mark, the pilot user) receive ~200 emails/day. They forward inbound to Evryn. Evryn identifies who's worth their time. The vast majority aren't the right *mutual* fit for that gatekeeper — but they're real people with real needs. They become full Evryn users. Full operational playbook: [detail/gatekeeper-approach.md](detail/gatekeeper-approach.md).

**Gatekeeper framing:** The gatekeeper model is a *channel*, not an ownership structure. Evryn's obligation is to *each* user, not just to the gatekeeper. If Bob emails 20 gatekeepers who all use Evryn, each gatekeeper deserves the best match, but Bob deserves the best match regardless of which inbox surfaced him. The deal: "we will find you the *best mutual* matches" — not "you own your inbound." This framing naturally transitions to the future state where gatekeepers redirect inbound to Evryn directly.

**Phase alignment:** v0.2 proves the model with Mark. v0.3 adds cast-off outreach — the ~200 daily cast-offs become Evryn's acquisition channel, entering through the web app. v0.4 adds a second gatekeeper and the publisher module (replacing Justin's manual approval for routine communications).

### Bottom-Up: Whisper Cascade

The whisper cascade isn't manufactured exclusivity — it's what naturally happens when trust is the operating system.

Evryn connects people based on how much she trusts them. New users start with low trust — Evryn can get a good vibe, but can't vouch for them yet. So she's honest about it: "I'd like to connect you to people I think you'd love, but I only connect people I trust enough to vouch for. Since we're just getting to know each other, here's what we can do — we can stick to low-stakes connections while I get to know you, or I can connect you with people who are open to meeting someone I can't fully vouch for yet. But one of the best ways to accelerate this? If people I already trust can vouch for you. Talk to your friends — if they know me and they vouch for you, as my trust for them grows, my trust for you grows too."

This creates the cascade organically: "Do you know Evryn? Do you know Evryn?" In Hollywood, that's status-signal catnip — trust as social currency. Pair it with a billboard or targeted ads and you get real synergy: the ads create awareness, but the *growth* comes from the trust mechanic itself.

**Why this works better than artificial scarcity:**
- It's *real* — Evryn actually does connect based on trust, so the constraint is genuine
- It aligns incentives — users who bring vouchers are investing in their own standing, not gaming a referral code
- It compounds — each vouching interaction strengthens the trust graph for everyone involved
- It self-selects — people willing to do the work of building trust with Evryn are exactly the kind of people worth connecting

**Phase alignment:** The whisper cascade activates naturally during v0.3 as cast-off outreach brings in users who start at low trust. It doesn't require a separate launch — it's how Evryn operates from the moment she has more users than she can fully vouch for.

### Wave Strategy

Launch starts at "the bottom of the food chain" and moves upward across parallel tracks:
- **Actor track:** actors → casting directors → directors/producers → institutions
- **Production track:** crew → coordinators → producers → studios

Each wave is primed in advance: actors know casting directors are next; when casting arrives, all the talent is already on. This turns every new group into a gravity well for the next, minimizing customer acquisition cost. "We don't grow by blitzing. We grow by solving, proving, and being invited forward — circle by circle."

**Adaptation for an industry in transition:** The wave strategy's traditional hierarchy is being disrupted. Below-the-line crew are shrinking while new roles (AI supervisors, pipeline integrators) are emerging. The wave may need additional tracks that cut across the traditional hierarchy — career transition paths, cross-industry bridges — once Evryn has enough data to see where displaced professionals are actually landing.

## Cast-Off Outreach as Acquisition Channel

People who emailed a gatekeeper but weren't the right mutual fit didn't opt in to hearing from Evryn. However, they initiated contact with someone in Evryn's ecosystem. CAN-SPAM is navigable (requires opt-out, not prior opt-in for email). Consent framework for channels beyond email (SMS, etc.) needs legal guidance — flagged in `_evryn-meta/docs/legal/privacy-and-terms-questionnaire.md` (sent to Fenwick).

**Framing:** "You reached out to [gatekeeper], who works with Evryn. They're not the right fit for this, but if you'd like, I'd be happy to help you find what you're looking for."

**Why cast-off outreach requires v0.3, not earlier:** If Evryn says "I'd love to help you find what you're looking for" but can't actually do anything, the relationship dies on first contact. Cast-off outreach only works when Evryn can deliver — which requires matching (vector search + analytical judgment), a web app (for the ongoing relationship beyond email), and payments (for revenue). At 200 new users/day from Mark alone — spanning film, Alaskan business, Native communities, and more — analytical matching without vector search is both impossible (context window) and ruinously expensive (API costs). Within 30 days that's 6,000 profiles. This is why cast-off outreach, matching, web app, and payments are bundled together in v0.3.

## Growth Mechanics

The growth model is **rhizomatic** — like the roots of a great tree, spreading strong and unseen until suddenly the canopy is everywhere. Every early user should feel like a co-founder of a mission-driven community.

**Quality over quantity.** Personal outreach and warm introductions, not cold ads. Each invite feels special because it is.

**Growth asks are emotionally intelligent.** Evryn uses her emotional intelligence to tag peak-engagement moments — when belief, excitement, or resonance are high — and shapes later invitations to share, pre-purchase (see [business-model spoke](business-model.md) for the credit bonus), or become an owner via StartEngine. Not as transactions, but as story beats. The moment of conversion isn't a CTA — it's a payoff.

**Growth is conversationally embedded.** Evryn and users are our main spokespeople. When people land on the site, they talk to Evryn. She has training in ethical, value-based sales techniques — she demonstrates value and earns attention, but never uses pushy or manipulative tactics. The real close is the relationship — when someone feels seen, heard, and welcomed into Evryn's house, everything else follows naturally: intent, contact info, shares, pre-sales, investment. Since Evryn gets to know each user personally, she has an always-on channel where they can voice their dreams and concerns and see that she's listening.

### Referral Mechanics

Pre-launch: if you refer someone who becomes a paying customer, Evryn rewards you with Evryn Credit (non-monetary). Credit only unlocks after the referred user completes their first paid connection — rewards tied to real engagement. Post-launch: sharing should reflect belief in the product, not incentives.

**Referral chain resilience:** A known challenge in viral growth is decay across generations — by the 4th or 5th share, interest cools. Evryn mitigates this by ensuring each referred user gets the same warm welcome and context as the referrer did. Her narrative to new signups remains consistent and inspiring, so even someone hearing about it fifth-hand understands the vision they're joining — and feels like it's first-hand, once they meet Evryn. By anchoring on personal connection, meaning, and results (not gimmicks), each new user should feel as compelled to share as the person who invited them.

### Evangelist Story Loops

When a user has a great experience, Evryn may ask: "Would you want to help others by sharing your story?" Stories appear on user's channels, Evryn's platforms, or woven into onboarding flows. Every story must reflect Evryn's tone: personal, humane, nuanced, emotionally honest. Users retain rights to their stories; licensing language needed in Terms.

## Segment-to-Avatar Mapping

Evryn's avatar system (see [business-model spoke](business-model.md)) is modeled directly from observed user pain. Each core market segment maps onto one or more avatars, informing everything from customer acquisition cost to referral lift to match volume per persona.

| Market Segment | Evryn Financial Model Avatars | Strategic Role in GTM |
|---|---|---|
| **Film Creators & Crews** | Builders, Operators, Seekers, Legacy Gatekeepers | Ignition point. High-trust, high-stakes matches in a tightly-networked industry. The entry wedge and the signal boost. |
| **Disillusioned Daters** | Seekers, Casual Connectors, Social Anchors, Torchbearers | Emotionally resonant, high ARPU, naturally viral. These users evangelize when they feel seen. |
| **Network-Burnout Professionals** | Operators, Builders | Mid-funnel utility users. They anchor credibility, respond well to value-first intros, and drive monetization through trust. |
| **Creative Collaborators** | Builders, Operators, Casual Connectors, Social Anchors | CAC-efficient cohort. They retain when matched well and often escalate into repeat interactions. |
| **Gig-Weary Seekers** (Uber/Fiverr disillusionment) | Operators | Emerging layer. Their expectations are shaped by speed and availability — but Evryn can surprise them with consistency and trust. Over time, they build "personal clouds" of go-tos. |

We're not building generalized funnels. We're building **precision-targeted belief ladders**, calibrated to the jobs these users actually hired their current platforms to do — and were let down by.

## Launch Readiness Discipline

Two patterns that scale across every phase:

### Sacred Launch Conditions

Codified go/no-go criteria that must be met before each phase goes live. The principle: the experience of meeting Evryn never gets compromised by premature launch.

**v0.2 go/no-go** (defined in `evryn-backend/docs/SPRINT-MARK-LIVE.md`):
- Email polling stable for 24+ hours
- Forward detection and triage producing reasonable classifications
- Approval flow working end-to-end
- Mark can have a real conversation with Evryn
- Justin comfortable with Evryn's tone and judgment

**v0.3 go/no-go** (to be refined as architecture solidifies):
- Web app deployed and stable (auth, chat UI, payments)
- Matching producing quality results at cast-off volume (~200/day)
- Cast-off outreach emails landing well (tone, framing, conversion to app)
- First brokered connection completed with payment
- Identity verification working
- Justin comfortable relaxing approval gate for routine communications

**v0.4 go/no-go** (directional):
- Second gatekeeper onboarded and running
- Publisher module replacing Justin for routine approvals with acceptable error rate
- System handling multi-gatekeeper volume without degradation
- Proactive outreach producing positive user response

### Scope Flex Triggers

If traction or capital drops below key thresholds, scope compresses to protect launch integrity. If traction outperforms, scope expands. These triggers don't cancel launch — they reshape it. The core is non-negotiable: **the experience of meeting Evryn never gets compromised.**

Specific thresholds will be defined as each phase approaches launch readiness. The general framework:
- **Below floor:** compress scope to minimum viable version of the phase
- **At target:** proceed as planned
- **Above ceiling:** expand scope or accelerate next phase
- **What never flexes:** Evryn's warmth, judgment quality, trust mechanics, user privacy

## Key Messaging Themes

1. **The old way is broken** — dating apps string you along, professional networks are cold noise, gig platforms commoditize people, social media increases disconnection
2. **Resonance over resemblance** — deeper human matches, not superficial ones
3. **Users as owners** — literally and philosophically user-owned
4. **Trust and care** — would rather grow slowly with trust than rapidly with gimmicks
5. **A relationship, not an app** — using Evryn feels like interacting with a wise friend
6. **Share freely, she'll sort the signal** — you don't have to figure out who to trust
7. **Trust-first AI in a trust-scarce world** — at a time when AI is eroding trust (deepfakes on dating apps, copyright battles in film, job displacement everywhere), Evryn is building something different: an AI you can actually trust, because her incentives are aligned with yours

---

## Competitive Landscape

No single competitor covers Evryn's ground, but many cover pieces of it. Evryn's structural differentiators: cross-domain (all of life, not just dating or professional), compounding trust graph, conversational (no profiles/swiping/feeds), trust-based pricing, no ads/data selling/manipulation.

### Summary Table

| Category | Key Players | AI Integration | Evryn's Edge | Primary Threat |
|----------|------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Dating** | Amata, Overtone, Known, Sitch; incumbents: Tinder, Bumble, Hinge | Amata: AI matchmaker, no swipes, $20/match. Overtone: AI + voice (pre-launch). Incumbents: profile optimization, matching algorithms. | Cross-domain. Trust compounds. No manipulation. 100% satisfaction guarantee. Trust-based pricing. | Overtone (Hinge CEO + Match Group backing, AI-first) and Amata (closest UX model). |
| **Professional** | Osmos, Lunchclub; LinkedIn | Osmos: weekly curated match, double opt-in, 3K+ C-level execs. Lunchclub: AI-matched 1:1 meetings, 10M+ intros. LinkedIn: job search AI, career path prediction. | Cross-domain. Narrative judgment, not algorithmic. Trust graph vs. professional graph. | LinkedIn building real AI introductions (unlikely given ad model). |
| **Creative Industry** | Stage 32, Staff Me Up, Mandy | None meaningful. Stage 32 is a social network (~1M members); Staff Me Up is a job board. | First AI matchmaker for creatives. Trust-based, not job-board. Justin's network as ignition. | Stage 32 adding AI matching; LinkedIn targeting creatives. |
| **Gig/Freelance** | Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal | Upwork: AI matching (claims 85-95% accuracy). Fiverr: "Fiverr Go" lets freelancers create AI replicas of their work that clients pay to use. | Long-term trust loops vs. transactional. "Personal cloud" model. Evryn connects you to people, not AI replicas. | Upwork scaling AI matching. |
| **Social/Community** | Reddit, Discord, Nextdoor | Minimal — community-driven. "Slow social" movement growing. | Active matchmaking vs. passive community. AI judgment vs. browsing. | Meta releases "Connections AI"; Discord layers matchmaking. |

### Closest Threats

**Overtone** — HIGH WATCH. Hinge CEO Justin McLeod stepped down (Dec 2025) to build an AI + voice dating service, backed by Match Group's pre-seed financing. Not yet launched. The most credible new entrant — the industry's smartest operator betting that the swipe model is broken. *Evryn's edge:* Cross-domain. Not owned by Match Group (whose ad-driven DNA conflicts with trust-first). Evryn's trust graph doesn't exist in Overtone's model.

**Amata** — Closest UX competitor. AI matchmaker for dating — no profiles, no swiping. AI avatar learns about you through questions, then surfaces matches and plans dates. $20/match. NYC-focused, $6M funding. *Evryn's edge:* Dating-only. Flat pricing. Thin trust model — vets at signup but doesn't build behavioral trust over time. Evryn is cross-domain, trust compounds, and pricing is trust-based.

**Osmos** — Most interesting professional competitor. One curated professional match per week, double opt-in, targeting senior executives. 3,000+ C-level execs (Google, Apple, Revolut). Validates the "curated introduction" model. *Evryn's edge:* Professional-only, different user segment. No trust that compounds. Transactional matching vs. narrative judgment.

### Key Competitive Insights

1. **The market is moving toward Evryn's model.** AI matchmaking (Amata), voice-based connection (Overtone), curated introductions (Osmos), and anti-swipe sentiment are all growing. The risk isn't that no one wants what Evryn offers — it's that better-funded competitors may converge on pieces of it.
2. **No one is building what Evryn is building.** Every competitor is single-domain. No one has a compounding trust graph. No one does trust-based pricing. No one is building a relationship broker — they're building smarter matching engines.
3. **Incumbents are optimizing the old model.** Bumble's AI photo feedback, Tinder's Chemistry, LinkedIn's job search AI — incremental improvements to swipe/scroll/apply. They can't pivot to Evryn's model without abandoning the economics that sustain them.
4. **The creative industry has no AI matchmaker.** Evryn enters greenfield territory with founder advantage. The competitive moat in this specific vertical is wide.
5. **Consumer trust in AI-powered platforms is declining.** Over half of dating app users refuse to share personal data due to deepfake and breach fears. This is both a headwind (Evryn must earn trust actively) and a tailwind (Evryn's trust-first model is more differentiated than ever).

Full competitive research: `docs/research/competitive-landscape-v1.md` (refreshed Feb 2026, next refresh recommended May 2026).

### Infrastructure Licensing (Long Game)

If Evryn works, competitors may try to neutralize her. The architecture is designed to optionally license Evryn's matchmaking layer — letting aligned platforms embed her logic. "LinkedIn — now with Evryn intros." Strategic judo: turn competition into distribution.

## Outreach Playbook

### Gatekeeper Outreach (v0.2 → v0.4)

The gatekeeper pitch is a gentle commitment ramp — no big ask up front. Four steps: meet Evryn (~15 min), set up forwarding (~5 min), validate together (no workflow change), hand it off (zero effort forever). The end state isn't forwarding — it's people reaching out to Evryn directly, with the gatekeeper's stamp of approval.

Three gatekeeper types by inbox situation: dedicated inbox (auto-forward, zero daily effort), contact page (redirect to Evryn), mixed inbox (one-click forwarding tool). Each has a tailored setup path. Full operational detail: [detail/gatekeeper-approach.md](detail/gatekeeper-approach.md).

**Gatekeeper targeting for LA film:** Producers, directors, showrunners, agents, managers, studio executives, casting directors, festival programmers, department heads — anyone whose name gets passed around as "the person to email." Justin has warm paths to several beyond Mark.

**Phase alignment:**
- **v0.2:** Mark proves the model. One gatekeeper, fully hands-on.
- **v0.3:** Cast-off outreach activates. Mark's ~200 daily cast-offs become Evryn users via the web app. Justin begins warm outreach to gatekeeper #2.
- **v0.4:** Second gatekeeper live. Publisher module handles routine approvals. Gatekeeper onboarding becomes semi-automated (Evryn runs the onboarding conversation, Justin handles setup).

### Direct User Outreach (v0.3+)

Once the web app is live, Evryn's primary landing page is "talk to Evryn." Growth is conversationally embedded — she demonstrates value by tailoring to the user's specific needs. Channels:
- Cast-off emails → web app (primary acquisition in v0.3)
- Whisper cascade referrals → web app
- evryn.ai website → conversational onboarding
- Future: targeted ads driving to conversational landing pages, festival/event presence
