## Strategic Context (as of Feb 2026)

The Master Plan's GTM was written assuming a traditional startup with a human tech team — expensive burn rate, need for significant funding before launch, pressure for a big coordinated launch to overcome the cold-start problem. The AI-first pivot fundamentally changes this calculus:

- **Dramatically lower burn.** With Justin as sole human operator building primarily with AI (Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK), monthly costs are a fraction of what a human engineering team would require. This removes the urgency to raise large rounds before proving the model.
- **Organic launch becomes viable.** Lower burn means Evryn can grow at the pace trust requires — no need to force premature scale to justify headcount or runway.
- **Gatekeeper strategy reduces cold-start pressure.** Each gatekeeper partnership brings ~200 potential users/day organically. Even one active gatekeeper generates meaningful network density without a marketing blitz.
- **But gatekeepers are hard to reach.** Justin has real inroads (Mark is the pilot, and there are warm paths to others), but most gatekeepers will treat Evryn's pitch as part of their own slush pile. The bottom-up whisper cascade strategy is still essential — it builds the social proof and user base that makes gatekeepers take notice.
- **User-owned positioning is a structural advantage.** Evryn is a Delaware PBC with a plan to move trust data to an independent Swiss Foundation. In an environment where consumer trust in AI platforms is actively declining — deepfakes on dating apps, copyright battles in film, data breaches everywhere — "no overlords" isn't just messaging. It's a competitive moat that VC-funded competitors structurally cannot replicate. See `docs/sessions/2026-02-28-business-model-revision-notes.md` for the full VC positioning framework.

**Bottom line:** The strategic direction below is correct — film industry first, wave strategy, whisper cascade, quality over quantity. What's evolved is the *urgency and scale assumptions*. Evryn can afford to grow more deliberately, prove the model at small scale, and let traction speak for itself.

**Build phases, target dates, and GTM alignment:**
- **v0.2 "Gatekeeper's Inbox"** (target: Mark live ~March 10-12, stabilize through March 14) — Mark live, triage running, user records accumulating. GTM is one gatekeeper proving the model.
- **v0.3 "The Broker"** (target: DC starts ~March 17, first revenue late April / early May) — Web app + matching + payments + cast-off outreach. GTM shifts: cast-offs become the acquisition channel (~200 new users/day from Mark alone), first revenue flows, whisper cascade begins organically. **SIFF (Seattle International Film Festival, mid-May to early June) is a real target for presence.**
- **v0.4 "Scale"** (target: June/July, after v0.3 stabilizes) — Second gatekeeper, begins to test the publisher module (replacing Justin's manual approval), agents come online. GTM widens: wave strategy activates across multiple gatekeeper channels, proactive outreach, Lucas manages operations. Union contract negotiation window (May-July 2026) overlaps — film professionals are anxious, trusted connections matter most.

## Film Industry as Ignition Point

The plan targets the film industry first because:
- Highest need for quality introductions — everyone is either clamoring for attention they can't get or drowning in attention they don't want
- Highly collaborative — no one makes a movie alone — mixing business, creative, social, romantic, and big money
- Very tight-knit — each new user knows 300-5,000 qualified leads
- Current tools are woefully inadequate (Facebook threads, job boards, DM chains, referral lists)
- Justin's extensive reach (~40 highly connected film people × ~2,000 contacts each ≈ 78,000 second-gen contacts, plus ~600-700 direct film/theatre/adjacent contacts)
- **Follow-through as differentiator:** In the film industry, introductions aren't enough — follow-through matters. By facilitating payments and re-engagements, Evryn becomes not just the introducer, but the connective tissue for real working relationships. This is a core differentiator at launch.

### Where We Start: Pacific Northwest

The long-term target is LA — densest film community in the world, and capturing LA opens up the rest of the industry. But the honest ignition point is the **Pacific Northwest:**

- **Mark (pilot gatekeeper) is in Seattle.** His inbound spans globally (filmmakers everywhere email him), but his personal network for gatekeeper introductions is PNW-heavy.
- **Megan Griffiths (film advisor) is in Seattle.** She knows "a ton" of people who'd need the gatekeeper version — mostly indie producers, but also department heads and casting folks. She's very connected to SIFF and can open doors there.
- **Justin's direct contacts are primarily Seattle.** ~600-700 film/theatre/adjacent contacts, mostly PNW. Only a few of the 40 highly-connected contacts have been approached so far.
- **Both Mark and Megan know LA people** and can make introductions — but the shortest, warmest path to gatekeepers #2 and #3 runs through Seattle.

**We don't have to choose.** There's no subscription churn — if someone in Portland or New York tries Evryn and there aren't matches in their area yet, Evryn says "we haven't officially launched in your area, but I'll keep an eye out" and surprises them later when a match materializes. Focus density efforts where the warm paths are (Seattle), let growth spread wherever it spreads, and expand to LA when connections are in hand.

**Seattle has its own acute need.** The "Seattle Freeze" is real — Seattle consistently ranks among America's loneliest cities. The social fabric problem isn't just an abstract national trend; it may be ground zero for the loneliness epidemic. Evryn's positioning resonates especially hard here.

**Action needed:** Go through Justin's contacts, figure out where they are geographically, and start warming the most promising paths — particularly the ~40 highly-connected film people (only a few contacted so far).

### An Industry in Transition

The film industry is contracting faster than most people realize, and AI is accelerating the shift. This makes Evryn *more* urgent, not less — and changes *what kinds of connections* people need.

**The numbers:** LA County has lost 41,000 film and TV jobs — a quarter of its entertainment workforce — in three years. 204,000 entertainment jobs projected displaced. LA on-location filming dropped 16.1% in 2025. Only 24 of 87 scripted projects filmed even partly in LA. Production fleeing to Georgia, New Mexico, the UK, and Canada. 2026 is the year of professional AI video adoption — broadcast-quality tools are absorbing entry-level jobs (compositing, rotoscoping, rough edits), breaking the traditional career ladder at the bottom rungs.

**All four major union contracts expire mid-2026** — SAG-AFTRA (June 30), DGA (June 30), WGA (May 1), IATSE (July 31). Studios are offering 5-year contracts (vs. 3-year) with a $100M health plan lifeline — locking in AI protections for half a decade while AI capabilities evolve rapidly. The negotiations will dominate industry conversation from May through July.

**What this means for Evryn:**
1. **The types of connections people need are shifting.** Traditional film collaboration ("find me a DP") is still needed but declining. Career transition connections, cross-industry introductions, and AI-related connections are growing. Evryn should serve both needs.
2. **Gatekeepers may get different inbound.** As the industry contracts, gatekeepers like Mark may receive more desperate or transition-oriented outreach alongside traditional pitches. Someone who isn't a fit for Mark's film projects might be a perfect Evryn user for other connection types.
3. **The wave strategy will almost certainly need continuous adaptation.** Below-the-line crew are shrinking. New roles (AI supervisors, pipeline integrators) will almost certainly create new wave paths.
4. **Trust in AI is actively being eroded.** The Seedance 2.0 copyright battle has made "AI" a loaded word in the film industry. Evryn is not an AI video tool — she's a trusted connector who happens to be AI-powered. Evryn's approach should lead with trust, relationship, and human outcomes — not with "AI" as a feature.
5. **The contract negotiation window (May-July 2026) overlaps with v0.3's target timeline.** This is both sensitive and opportune — a moment when trusted connections matter most. We should be ready to seize the opportunity to help people find the connections that allow them to flourish in this changing landscape.

## Two Parallel Growth Channels

### Top-Down: Gatekeeper Partnerships

High-volume connectors (like Mark, the pilot user) receive ~200 emails/day. They forward inbound to Evryn. Evryn identifies who's worth their time. The vast majority aren't the right *mutual* fit for that gatekeeper — but they're real people with real needs. They become full Evryn users. Full operational playbook: [detail/gatekeeper-approach.md](detail/gatekeeper-approach.md).

**Gatekeeper framing:** The gatekeeper model is a *channel*, not an ownership structure. Evryn's obligation is to *each* user, not just to the gatekeeper. If Bob emails 20 gatekeepers who all use Evryn, each gatekeeper deserves the best match, but Bob deserves the best match regardless of which inbox surfaced him. The deal: "we will find you the *best mutual* matches" — not "you own your inbound." This framing naturally transitions to the future state where gatekeepers redirect inbound to Evryn directly.

**Phase alignment:** v0.2 proves the model with Mark (Seattle). v0.3 adds cast-off outreach — the ~200 daily cast-offs become Evryn's acquisition channel, entering through the web app. v0.4 adds a second gatekeeper (likely Seattle via Megan's connections — indie producers, department heads, casting) and begins to test the publisher module (replacing Justin's manual approval for routine communications).

### Bottom-Up: Whisper Cascade

The whisper cascade isn't manufactured exclusivity — it's what naturally happens when trust is the operating system.

Evryn connects people based on how much she trusts them. New users start with low trust — Evryn can get a good vibe, but can't vouch for them yet. So she's honest about it: "I'd like to connect you to people I think you'd love, but I only connect people I trust enough to vouch for. Since we're just getting to know each other, here's what we can do — we can stick to low-stakes connections while I get to know you, or I can connect you with people who are open to meeting someone I can't fully vouch for yet. But one of the best ways to accelerate this? If people I already trust can vouch for you. Talk to your friends — if they know me and they vouch for you, as my trust for them grows, my trust for you grows too."

This creates the cascade organically: "Do you know Evryn? Do you know Evryn?" In Hollywood — and Seattle's tight-knit film scene — that's status-signal catnip. Trust as social currency. Pair it with a billboard or targeted ads and you get real synergy: the ads create awareness, but the *growth* comes from the trust mechanic itself.

**Why this works better than artificial scarcity:**
- It's *real* — Evryn actually does connect based on trust, so the constraint is genuine
- It aligns incentives — users who bring vouchers are investing in their own standing, not gaming a referral code
- It compounds — each vouching interaction strengthens the trust graph for everyone involved
- It self-selects — people willing to do the work of building trust with Evryn are exactly the kind of people worth connecting

**"Candy before the store opens."** For users who are in the system before Evryn has officially launched in their area: "Hey, we haven't officially launched yet, but I think I might have stumbled upon someone you might like." Everyone loves getting something before the store opens. Target: every user gets their first match before official launch in their area. This turns pre-launch users into evangelists.

**Phase alignment:** The whisper cascade activates naturally during v0.3 as cast-off outreach brings in users who start at low trust. It doesn't require a separate launch — it's how Evryn operates from the moment she has more users than she can fully vouch for.

### Wave Strategy

Launch starts at "the bottom of the food chain" and moves upward across parallel tracks:
- **Actor track:** actors → casting directors → directors/producers → institutions
- **Production track:** crew → coordinators → producers → studios

Each wave is primed in advance: actors know casting directors are next; when casting arrives, all the talent is already on. This turns every new group into a gravity well for the next, minimizing customer acquisition cost. "We don't grow by blitzing. We grow by solving, proving, and being invited forward — circle by circle."

**Adaptation for an industry in transition:** The wave strategy's traditional hierarchy is being disrupted. Below-the-line crew are shrinking while new roles (AI supervisors, pipeline integrators) are emerging. The wave will almost certainly need additional tracks that cut across the traditional hierarchy — career transition paths, cross-industry bridges — once Evryn has enough data to see where displaced professionals are actually landing.

## Cast-Off Outreach as Acquisition Channel

People who emailed a gatekeeper but weren't the right mutual fit didn't opt in to hearing from Evryn. However, they initiated contact with someone in Evryn's ecosystem. CAN-SPAM is navigable (requires opt-out, not prior opt-in for email). Consent framework for channels beyond email (SMS, etc.) needs legal guidance — flagged in `_evryn-meta/docs/legal/privacy-and-terms-questionnaire.md` (under active consideration with Fenwick).

**Framing:** "You reached out to [gatekeeper], who works with Evryn. They're not the right fit for this, but if you'd like, I'd be happy to help you find what you're looking for."

**Why cast-off outreach requires v0.3, not earlier:** If Evryn says "I'd love to help you find what you're looking for" but can't actually do anything, the relationship dies on first contact. Cast-off outreach only works when Evryn can deliver — which requires matching (vector search + analytical judgment), a web app (for the ongoing relationship beyond email), and payments (for revenue). At 200 new users/day from Mark alone — spanning film, Alaskan business, Native communities, and more — analytical matching without vector search is both impossible (context window) and ruinously expensive (API costs). Within 30 days that's 6,000 profiles. This is why cast-off outreach, matching, web app, and payments are bundled together in v0.3.

**The backlog advantage:** By the time v0.3 activates cast-off outreach, v0.2 has been running for ~3 weeks. That's ~4,200 people in the system with user records. The backlog is reachable — people don't expect same-day responses from someone as busy as Mark. Even three-week-old outreach reads as warm and human: "I'm sorry it took me a bit to get back to you — Mark isn't available for this, but I'd love to help you find what you're looking for." In a world where ghosting is the norm, a late response beats no response. Evryn starts v0.3 with a meaningful head start.

## Growth Mechanics

The growth model is **rhizomatic** — like the roots of a great tree, spreading strong and unseen until suddenly the canopy is everywhere. Every early user should feel like a co-founder of a mission-driven community.

**Quality over quantity.** Personal outreach and warm introductions, not cold ads. Each invite feels special because it is.

**Growth asks are emotionally intelligent.** Evryn uses her emotional intelligence to tag peak-engagement moments — when belief, excitement, or resonance are high — and shapes later invitations to share, pre-purchase (see [business-model spoke](business-model.md) for the credit bonus), or become an owner via StartEngine. Not as transactions, but as story beats. The moment of conversion isn't a CTA — it's a payoff.

**Growth is conversationally embedded.** Evryn and users are our main spokespeople. When people land on the site, they talk to Evryn. She has training in ethical, value-based sales techniques — she demonstrates value and earns attention, but never uses pushy or manipulative tactics. The real close is the relationship — when someone feels seen, heard, and welcomed into Evryn's house, everything else follows naturally: intent, contact info, shares, pre-sales, investment. Since Evryn gets to know each user personally, she has an always-on channel where they can voice their dreams and concerns and see that she's listening.

### Referral Mechanics

Pre-launch: if you refer someone who becomes a paying customer, Evryn rewards you with Evryn Credit (non-monetary). Credit only unlocks after the referred user completes their first paid connection — rewards tied to real engagement. Post-launch: sharing should reflect belief in the product, not incentives.

**Referral chain resilience:** A known challenge in viral growth is decay across generations — by the 4th or 5th share, interest cools. Evryn mitigates this by ensuring each referred user gets the same warm welcome and context as the referrer did. Her narrative to new signups remains consistent and inspiring, so even someone hearing about it fifth-hand understands the vision they're joining — and feels like it's first-hand, once they meet Evryn. By anchoring on personal connection, meaning, and results (not gimmicks), each new user should feel as compelled to share as the person who invited them.

### Evangelist Story Loops

When a user has a great experience, Evryn may ask: "Would you want to help others by sharing your story?" Stories appear on user's channels, Evryn's platforms, or woven into onboarding flows. Every story must reflect Evryn's tone: personal, humane, nuanced, emotionally honest. Users retain rights to their stories; licensing language needed in Terms.

## Segment-to-Avatar Mapping

Evryn's avatar system (see [business-model spoke](business-model.md)) is modeled directly from observed user pain. Each core market segment maps onto one or more avatars, informing everything from customer acquisition cost to referral lift to match volume per persona.

| Market Segment | Evryn Financial Model Avatars | Strategic Role in GTM |
|---|---|---|
| **Film Creators & Crews** | Builders, Operators, Seekers, Legacy Gatekeepers | Ignition point. High-trust, high-stakes matches in a tightly-networked industry. The entry wedge and the signal boost. |
| **Disillusioned Daters** | Seekers, Casual Connectors, Social Anchors, Torchbearers | Emotionally resonant, high ARPU, naturally viral. These users evangelize when they feel seen. |
| **Network-Burnout Professionals** | Operators, Builders | Mid-funnel utility users. They anchor credibility, respond well to value-first intros, and drive monetization through trust. |
| **Creative Collaborators** | Builders, Operators, Casual Connectors, Social Anchors | CAC-efficient cohort. They retain when matched well and often escalate into repeat interactions. |
| **Gig-Weary Seekers** (Uber/Fiverr disillusionment) | Operators | Emerging layer. Their expectations are shaped by speed and availability — but Evryn can surprise them with consistency and trust. Over time, they build "personal clouds" of go-tos. |

We're not building generalized funnels. We're building **precision-targeted belief ladders**, calibrated to the jobs these users actually hired their current platforms to do — and were let down by.

## Launch Readiness Discipline

Two patterns that scale across every phase:

### Sacred Launch Conditions

Codified go/no-go criteria that must be met before each phase goes live. The principle: the experience of meeting Evryn never gets compromised by premature launch.

**v0.2 go/no-go** (defined in `evryn-backend/docs/SPRINT-MARK-LIVE.md`):
- Email polling stable for 24+ hours
- Forward detection and triage producing reasonable classifications
- Approval flow working end-to-end
- Mark can have a real conversation with Evryn
- Justin comfortable with Evryn's tone and judgment

**v0.3 go/no-go** (to be refined as architecture solidifies):
- Web app deployed and stable (auth, chat UI, payments)
- Matching producing quality results against an objective threshold — not "best available," but "good enough to vouch for" (e.g., 80%+ compatibility). If nobody clears the bar, nobody gets matched. We wait.
- Cast-off outreach emails landing well (tone, framing, conversion to app)
- First brokered connection completed with payment
- Identity verification working
- Justin comfortable relaxing approval gate for routine communications
- Active user acquisition working (Evryn recruiting supply-side to satisfy demand — see Outreach Playbook)

**v0.4 go/no-go** (directional):
- Second gatekeeper onboarded and running
- Publisher module replacing Justin for routine approvals with acceptable error rate
- System handling multi-gatekeeper volume without degradation
- Proactive outreach producing positive user response

### Scope Flex Triggers

If traction or capital drops below key thresholds, scope compresses to protect launch integrity. If traction outperforms, scope expands. These triggers don't cancel launch — they reshape it. The core is non-negotiable: **the experience of meeting Evryn never gets compromised.**

Specific thresholds will be defined as each phase approaches launch readiness. The general framework:
- **Below floor:** compress scope to minimum viable version of the phase
- **At target:** proceed as planned
- **Above ceiling:** expand scope or accelerate next phase
- **What never flexes:** Evryn's warmth, judgment quality, trust mechanics, user privacy

## Key Messaging Themes

1. **The old way is broken** — dating apps string you along, professional networks are cold noise, gig platforms commoditize people, social media increases disconnection
2. **Resonance over resemblance** — deeper human matches, not superficial ones
3. **Users as owners** — literally and philosophically user-owned. "Help us make this into something that can't be corrupted." (See v0.1 ownership script in `evryn-backend/docs/historical/Evryn_0.1_Instructions_Prompts_Scripts/The_Beautiful_Language_of_Evryn_v0.9.md`, lines 157-204 — the exact tone we want.)
4. **Trust and care** — would rather grow slowly with trust than rapidly with gimmicks
5. **A relationship, not an app** — using Evryn feels like interacting with a wise friend
6. **Share freely, she'll sort the signal** — you don't have to figure out who to trust
7. **Trust-first AI in a trust-scarce world** — at a time when AI is eroding trust (deepfakes on dating apps, copyright battles in film, job displacement everywhere), Evryn is building something different: an AI you can actually trust, because her incentives are aligned with yours. No overlords. No data selling. Trust data moving to an independent foundation. "We're trying really hard not to need outside money — help us make this into something too strong to corrupt."

## Competitive Landscape

No single competitor covers Evryn's ground, but many cover pieces of it. Evryn's structural differentiators: cross-domain (all of life, not just dating or professional), compounding trust graph, conversational (no profiles/swiping/feeds), trust-based pricing, no ads/data selling/manipulation, PBC + Foundation architecture.

### Summary Table

| Category | Key Players | AI Integration | Evryn's Edge | Primary Threat |
|----------|------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Dating** | Amata, Overtone, Known, Sitch; incumbents: Tinder, Bumble, Hinge | Amata: AI matchmaker, no swipes, $20/match. Overtone: AI + voice (pre-launch). Incumbents: profile optimization, matching algorithms. | Cross-domain. Trust compounds. No manipulation. 100% satisfaction guarantee. Trust-based pricing. User-owned. | Overtone (Hinge CEO + Match Group backing, AI-first) and Amata (closest UX model). |
| **Professional** | Osmos, Lunchclub; LinkedIn | Osmos: weekly curated match, double opt-in, 3K+ C-level execs. Lunchclub: AI-matched 1:1 meetings, 10M+ intros. LinkedIn: job search AI, career path prediction. | Cross-domain. Narrative judgment, not algorithmic. Trust graph vs. professional graph. | LinkedIn building real AI introductions (unlikely given ad model). |
| **Creative Industry** | Stage 32, Staff Me Up, Mandy | None meaningful. Stage 32 is a social network (~1M members); Staff Me Up is a job board. | First AI matchmaker for creatives. Trust-based, not job-board. Justin's network as ignition. | Stage 32 adding AI matching; LinkedIn targeting creatives. |
| **Gig/Freelance** | Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal | Upwork: AI matching (claims 85-95% accuracy). Fiverr: "Fiverr Go" lets freelancers create AI replicas of their work that clients pay to use. | Long-term trust loops vs. transactional. "Personal cloud" model. Evryn connects you to people, not AI replicas. | Upwork scaling AI matching. |
| **Social/Community** | Reddit, Discord, Nextdoor | Minimal — community-driven. "Slow social" movement growing. | Active matchmaking vs. passive community. AI judgment vs. browsing. | Meta releases "Connections AI"; Discord layers matchmaking. |

### Closest Threats

**Overtone** — HIGH WATCH. Hinge CEO Justin McLeod stepped down (Dec 2025) to build an AI + voice dating service, backed by Match Group's pre-seed financing. Not yet launched. The most credible new entrant — the industry's smartest operator betting that the swipe model is broken. *Evryn's edge:* Cross-domain. Not owned by Match Group (whose ad-driven DNA conflicts with trust-first). Evryn's trust graph doesn't exist in Overtone's model. Evryn is user-owned; Overtone is VC-backed.

**Amata** — Closest UX competitor. AI matchmaker for dating — no profiles, no swiping. AI avatar learns about you through questions, then surfaces matches and plans dates. $20/match. NYC-focused, $6M funding. *Evryn's edge:* Dating-only. Flat pricing. Thin trust model — vets at signup but doesn't build behavioral trust over time. Evryn is cross-domain, trust compounds, and pricing is trust-based.

**Osmos** — Most interesting professional competitor. One curated professional match per week, double opt-in, targeting senior executives. 3,000+ C-level execs (Google, Apple, Revolut). Validates the "curated introduction" model. *Evryn's edge:* Professional-only, different user segment. No trust that compounds. Transactional matching vs. narrative judgment.

### Key Competitive Insights

1. **The market is moving toward Evryn's model.** AI matchmaking (Amata), voice-based connection (Overtone), curated introductions (Osmos), and anti-swipe sentiment are all growing. The risk isn't that no one wants what Evryn offers — it's that better-funded competitors may converge on pieces of it.
2. **No one is building what Evryn is building.** Every competitor is single-domain. No one has a compounding trust graph. No one does trust-based pricing. No one is building a relationship broker — they're building smarter matching engines.
3. **Incumbents are optimizing the old model.** Bumble's AI photo feedback, Tinder's Chemistry, LinkedIn's job search AI — incremental improvements to swipe/scroll/apply. They can't pivot to Evryn's model without abandoning the economics that sustain them.
4. **The creative industry has no AI matchmaker.** Evryn enters greenfield territory with founder advantage. The competitive moat in this specific vertical is wide.
5. **Consumer trust in AI-powered platforms is declining.** Over half of dating app users refuse to share personal data due to deepfake and breach fears. This is both a headwind (Evryn must earn trust actively) and a tailwind (Evryn's trust-first, user-owned model is more differentiated than ever).

Full competitive research: `docs/research/competitive-landscape-v1.md` (refreshed Feb 2026, next refresh recommended May 2026).

### Infrastructure Licensing (Long Game)

If Evryn works, competitors may try to neutralize her. The architecture is designed to optionally license Evryn's matchmaking layer — letting aligned platforms embed her logic. "LinkedIn — now with Evryn intros." Strategic judo: turn competition into distribution.

## Outreach Playbook

### Gatekeeper Outreach (v0.2 → v0.4)

The gatekeeper pitch is a gentle commitment ramp — no big ask up front. Four steps: meet Evryn (~15 min), set up forwarding (~5 min), validate together (no workflow change), hand it off (zero effort forever). The end state isn't forwarding — it's people reaching out to Evryn directly, with the gatekeeper's stamp of approval.

Three gatekeeper types by inbox situation: dedicated inbox (auto-forward, zero daily effort), contact page (redirect to Evryn), mixed inbox (one-click forwarding tool). Each has a tailored setup path. Full operational detail: [detail/gatekeeper-approach.md](detail/gatekeeper-approach.md).

**Gatekeeper targeting for film (Seattle first, then LA):**
- **Seattle (warm paths now):** Megan knows indie producers, department heads, and casting folks who get heavy inbound. Mark knows additional Seattle film people. These are the most reachable next gatekeepers.
- **LA (expansion):** Via introductions from Mark, Megan, and Justin's direct contacts. Harder to reach cold, but proof of concept from Seattle changes the pitch.
- **Gatekeeper archetypes across both cities:** Producers, directors, showrunners, agents, managers, studio executives, casting directors, festival programmers, department heads — anyone whose name gets passed around as "the person to email."

**Phase alignment:**
- **v0.2:** Mark proves the model. One gatekeeper, fully hands-on.
- **v0.3:** Cast-off outreach activates. Mark's ~200 daily cast-offs become Evryn users via the web app. Justin begins warm outreach to gatekeeper #2 (likely via Megan's connections). **Target SIFF (mid-May to early June) for presence** — both Mark and Megan are connected there.
- **v0.4:** Second gatekeeper live. Publisher module begins testing. Gatekeeper onboarding becomes semi-automated (Evryn runs the onboarding conversation, Justin handles setup).

### Active User Acquisition (v0.3+)

Two distinct modes of active acquisition, both essential:

**Growth marketing (Jordan, CGO agent — v0.4+):** Organic outreach on forums, communities, any pathway that doesn't require ad spend. Before revenue AND after, beating the bushes is primary. Jordan finds people who might need Evryn and points them her way. This is awareness, not brokering.

**Supply-side recruiting (Evryn herself — v0.3):** When a user says "I need a plumber" and Evryn doesn't have one, she goes and finds one. "Hey, your reviews look amazing — I have someone who'd love to work with you." This IS brokering — warm, personal, on-brand. The recruited person's first connection is free (they didn't ask for this), but they know what Evryn charges ("connections like this typically run about $20 — this first one is my treat"). Subsequent connections are paid. Full pricing framework: `docs/sessions/2026-02-28-business-model-revision-notes.md`.

### Direct User Outreach (v0.3+)

Once the web app is live, Evryn's primary landing page is "talk to Evryn." Growth is conversationally embedded — she demonstrates value by tailoring to the user's specific needs. Channels:
- Cast-off emails → web app (primary acquisition in v0.3)
- Whisper cascade referrals → web app
- evryn.ai website → conversational onboarding
- Future: targeted ads driving to conversational landing pages, festival/event presence (SIFF as first target)
