## Strategic Context (as of Feb 2026)

The Master Plan's GTM was written assuming a traditional startup with a human tech team — expensive burn rate, need for significant funding before launch, pressure for a big coordinated launch to overcome the cold-start problem. The AI-first pivot fundamentally changes this calculus:

- **Dramatically lower burn.** With Justin as sole human operator building primarily with AI (Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK), monthly costs are a fraction of what a human engineering team would require. This removes the urgency to raise large rounds before proving the model.
- **Organic launch becomes viable.** Lower burn means Evryn can grow at the pace trust requires — no need to force premature scale to justify headcount or runway.
- **Gatekeeper strategy reduces cold-start pressure.** Each gatekeeper partnership brings ~200 potential users/day organically. Even one active gatekeeper generates meaningful network density without a marketing blitz.
- **But gatekeepers are hard to reach.** Justin has real inroads (Mark is the pilot, and there are warm paths to others), but most gatekeepers will treat Evryn's pitch as part of their own slush pile. The bottom-up whisper cascade strategy is still essential — it builds the social proof and user base that makes gatekeepers take notice.

**Bottom line:** The strategic direction below is correct — LA film first, wave strategy, whisper cascade, quality over quantity. What's evolved is the *urgency and scale assumptions*. Evryn can afford to grow more deliberately, prove the model at small scale, and let traction speak for itself. The funding milestones and launch timelines from the Master Plan are being rethought accordingly.

## LA Film Industry as Ignition Point

The plan targets Los Angeles film industry first because:
- Highest need for quality introductions — everyone is either clamoring for attention they can't get or drowning in attention they don't want
- Highly collaborative — no one makes a movie alone — mixing business, creative, social, romantic, and big money
- Very tight-knit — each new user knows 300-5,000 qualified leads
- Current tools are woefully inadequate (Facebook threads, job boards, DM chains, referral lists)
- Justin's extensive reach (78,000+ second-gen contacts)
- **Industry in transition:** Between film advisor Megan Griffiths and independent research, we're discovering that the film industry is evaporating faster than expected with the rise of AI video tools. This makes Evryn more urgent, not less — film professionals need to (1) find their best connections in a shrinking landscape, and (2) find their *next* opportunities as film work becomes fewer and further between. Evryn helps with both.
- **Follow-through as differentiator:** In the film industry, introductions aren't enough — follow-through matters. By facilitating payments and re-engagements, Evryn becomes not just the introducer, but the connective tissue for real working relationships. This is a core differentiator at launch.
- Capturing LA film opens up: rest of LA (everyone is connected to film), rest of the film industry globally, and the entertainment industry megaphone

## Two Parallel Growth Channels

### Top-Down: Gatekeeper Partnerships

High-volume connectors (like Mark, the pilot user) receive ~200 emails/day. They forward inbound to Evryn. Evryn identifies who's worth their time. The vast majority aren't the right *mutual* fit for that gatekeeper — but they're real people with real needs. They become full Evryn users. Full operational playbook: [detail/gatekeeper-approach.md](detail/gatekeeper-approach.md).

**Gatekeeper framing:** The gatekeeper model is a *channel*, not an ownership structure. Evryn's obligation is to *each* user, not just to the gatekeeper. If Bob emails 20 gatekeepers who all use Evryn, each gatekeeper deserves the best match, but Bob deserves the best match regardless of which inbox surfaced him. The deal: "we will find you the *best mutual* matches" — not "you own your inbound." This framing naturally transitions to the future state where gatekeepers redirect inbound to Evryn directly.

### Bottom-Up: Whisper Cascade

Invite-only positioning: "An invite-only platform where you get introduced to people who can change your career — but only if someone vouches for you." This triggers status-driven demand: "Do you know Evryn? Who can get me an invite?" Frames access as status, and status as prelude to serendipity.

### Wave Strategy

Launch starts at "the bottom of the food chain" and moves upward across parallel tracks:
- **Actor track:** actors → casting directors → directors/producers → institutions
- **Production track:** crew → coordinators → producers → studios

Each wave is primed in advance: actors know casting directors are next; when casting arrives, all the talent is already on. This turns every new group into a gravity well for the next, minimizing customer acquisition cost. "We don't grow by blitzing. We grow by solving, proving, and being invited forward — circle by circle."

## Cast-Off Outreach

People who emailed a gatekeeper but weren't the right mutual fit didn't opt in to hearing from Evryn. However, they initiated contact with someone in Evryn's ecosystem. CAN-SPAM is navigable (requires opt-out, not prior opt-in for email).

**Framing:** "You reached out to [gatekeeper], who works with Evryn. They're not the right fit for this, but if you'd like, I'd be happy to help you find what you're looking for."

Consent framework for channels beyond email (SMS, etc.) needs legal guidance — flagged in `docs/legal/privacy-and-terms-questionnaire.md` (sent to Fenwick).

## Growth Mechanics

The growth model is **rhizomatic** — like the roots of a great tree, spreading strong and unseen until suddenly the canopy is everywhere. Every early user should feel like a co-founder of a mission-driven community.

**Quality over quantity.** Personal outreach and warm introductions, not cold ads. Each invite feels special because it is.

**Growth asks are emotionally intelligent.** Evryn uses her emotional intelligence to tag peak-engagement moments — when belief, excitement, or resonance are high — and shapes later invitations to share, pre-purchase (see [business-model spoke](business-model.md) for the credit bonus), or become an owner via StartEngine. Not as transactions, but as story beats. The moment of conversion isn't a CTA — it's a payoff.

**Growth is conversationally embedded.** Evryn and users are our main spokespeople. When people land on the site, they talk to Evryn. She has training in ethical, value-based sales techniques — she demonstrates value and earns attention, but never uses pushy or manipulative tactics. The real close is the relationship — when someone feels seen, heard, and welcomed into Evryn's house, everything else follows naturally: intent, contact info, shares, pre-sales, investment. Since Evryn gets to know each user personally, she has an always-on channel where they can voice their dreams and concerns and see that she's listening.

### Referral Mechanics

Pre-launch: if you refer someone who becomes a paying customer, Evryn rewards you with Evryn Credit (non-monetary). Credit only unlocks after the referred user completes their first paid connection — rewards tied to real engagement. Post-launch: sharing should reflect belief in the product, not incentives.

**Referral chain resilience:** A known challenge in viral growth is decay across generations — by the 4th or 5th share, interest cools. Evryn mitigates this by ensuring each referred user gets the same warm welcome and context as the referrer did. Her narrative to new signups remains consistent and inspiring, so even someone hearing about it fifth-hand understands the vision they're joining — and feels like it's first-hand, once they meet Evryn. By anchoring on personal connection, meaning, and results (not gimmicks), each new user should feel as compelled to share as the person who invited them.

### Evangelist Story Loops

When a user has a great experience, Evryn may ask: "Would you want to help others by sharing your story?" Stories appear on user's channels, Evryn's platforms, or woven into onboarding flows. Every story must reflect Evryn's tone: personal, humane, nuanced, emotionally honest. Users retain rights to their stories; licensing language needed in Terms.

## Segment-to-Avatar Mapping

Evryn's avatar system (see [business-model spoke](business-model.md)) is modeled directly from observed user pain. Each core market segment maps onto one or more avatars, informing everything from customer acquisition cost to referral lift to match volume per persona.

| Market Segment | Evryn Financial Model Avatars | Strategic Role in GTM |
|---|---|---|
| **Film Creators & Crews** | Builders, Operators, Seekers, Legacy Gatekeepers | Ignition point. High-trust, high-stakes matches in a tightly-networked industry. The entry wedge and the signal boost. |
| **Disillusioned Daters** | Seekers, Casual Connectors, Social Anchors, Torchbearers | Emotionally resonant, high ARPU, naturally viral. These users evangelize when they feel seen. |
| **Network-Burnout Professionals** | Operators, Builders | Mid-funnel utility users. They anchor credibility, respond well to value-first intros, and drive monetization through trust. |
| **Creative Collaborators** | Builders, Operators, Casual Connectors, Social Anchors | CAC-efficient cohort. They retain when matched well and often escalate into repeat interactions. |
| **Gig-Weary Seekers** (Uber/Fiverr disillusionment) | Operators | Emerging layer. Their expectations are shaped by speed and availability — but Evryn can surprise them with consistency and trust. Over time, they build "personal clouds" of go-tos. |

We're not building generalized funnels. We're building **precision-targeted belief ladders**, calibrated to the jobs these users actually hired their current platforms to do — and were let down by.

## Launch Readiness Discipline

The Master Plan established two related patterns worth preserving:

**Sacred launch conditions** — codified go/no-go criteria that must be met before launch. The specific conditions (team, funding, tech/legal stability, minimum network density) need updating for the AI-first pivot, but the principle of having explicit, non-negotiable launch gates is sound.

**Scope flex triggers** — if traction or capital drops below key thresholds, scope compresses to protect launch integrity. If traction outperforms, scope expands. These triggers don't cancel launch — they reshape it. The core is non-negotiable: **the experience of meeting Evryn never gets compromised.**

*Specific thresholds from the Master Plan (runway floors, user counts, compute costs) are stale post-AI-pivot. Updated triggers will be defined as v0.2 approaches launch readiness. See original Master Plan lines 969-978 and 1131-1158.*

## Key Messaging Themes

1. **The old way is broken** — dating apps string you along, professional networks are cold noise, gig platforms commoditize people, social media increases disconnection
2. **Resonance over resemblance** — deeper human matches, not superficial ones
3. **Users as owners** — literally and philosophically user-owned
4. **Trust and care** — would rather grow slowly with trust than rapidly with gimmicks
5. **A relationship, not an app** — using Evryn feels like interacting with a wise friend
6. **Share freely, she'll sort the signal** — you don't have to figure out who to trust

## Competitive Landscape

| Category | Current State | Evryn's Edge | Key Threats |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Film & Entertainment** | Fragmented, trust-starved, gatekept (Facebook groups, Stage32, StaffMeUp) | First to unify creative matchmaking under AI trust model. Justin's network as ignition. | LinkedIn targeting creatives; cultural pushback from gatekeepers |
| **Dating Apps** | Massive, churn-heavy, emotionally exhausted (Tinder, Hinge, Bumble) | No manipulation, no profiles, no swipes. Trust-first, outcome-focused. | Bumble pivoting into AI; Hinge copying outcome narrative |
| **Professional Networking** | Static, self-promotional, cold (LinkedIn, Lunchclub) | Actual introductions, double opt-in, multidimensional alignment. | LinkedIn builds real AI matchmaking |
| **Gig & Freelance** | Transactional, noisy, commoditized (Upwork, Fiverr, Uber) | Long-term trust loops. Match once, come back forever. | Upwork layering AI; Uber scaling personalization |
| **Social Media** | Massive, chaotic, wrong tool for connection (Facebook, Discord, Reddit) | Quiet, curated, personal. You don't scroll — you get introduced. | Meta releases "Connections AI"; Discord layers matchmaking |

### Infrastructure Licensing (Long Game)

If Evryn works, competitors may try to neutralize her. The architecture is designed to optionally license Evryn's matchmaking layer — letting aligned platforms embed her logic. "LinkedIn — now with Evryn intros." Strategic judo: turn competition into distribution.

> *Removed: month-by-month launch timeline targeting Dec 2025. Dates passed; being rebuilt as v0.2 pilot. See original Master Plan lines 921-1006.*
