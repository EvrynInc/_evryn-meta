# Go-to-Market & Growth

> **How to use this file:** Full depth on Evryn's GTM strategy, growth mechanics, and competitive landscape. The Hub carries current strategy and brief GTM summary; this spoke carries the full reasoning, wave strategy, messaging, and competitive analysis. Read this when working on growth features, outreach, or competitive positioning.

## Strategic Context (as of Feb 2026)

The Master Plan's GTM was written assuming a traditional startup with a human tech team — expensive burn rate, need for significant funding before launch, pressure for a big coordinated launch to overcome the cold-start problem. The AI-first pivot fundamentally changes this calculus:

- **Dramatically lower burn.** With Justin as sole human operator building primarily with AI (Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK), monthly costs are a fraction of what a human engineering team would require. This removes the urgency to raise large rounds before proving the model.
- **Organic launch becomes viable.** Lower burn means Evryn can grow at the pace trust requires — no need to force premature scale to justify headcount or runway.
- **Gatekeeper strategy reduces cold-start pressure.** Each gatekeeper partnership brings ~1,000 potential users/week organically. Even one active gatekeeper generates meaningful network density without a marketing blitz.
- **But gatekeepers are hard to reach.** Justin has real inroads (Mark is the pilot, and there are warm paths to others), but most gatekeepers will treat Evryn's pitch as part of their own slush pile. The bottom-up whisper cascade strategy is still essential — it builds the social proof and user base that makes gatekeepers take notice.

**Bottom line:** The strategic direction below is correct — LA film first, wave strategy, whisper cascade, quality over quantity. What's evolved is the *urgency and scale assumptions*. Evryn can afford to grow more deliberately, prove the model at small scale, and let traction speak for itself. The funding milestones and launch timelines from the Master Plan are being rethought accordingly.

## LA Film Industry as Ignition Point

The plan targets Los Angeles film industry first because:
- Highest need for quality introductions — everyone is either clamoring for attention they can't get or drowning in attention they don't want
- Highly collaborative — no one makes a movie alone — mixing business, creative, social, romantic, and big money
- Very tight-knit — each new user knows 300-5,000 qualified leads
- Current tools are woefully inadequate (Facebook threads, job boards, DM chains)
- Justin's extensive reach (78,000+ second-gen contacts)
- Capturing LA film opens up: rest of LA (everyone is connected to film), rest of the film industry globally, and the entertainment industry megaphone

## Two Parallel Growth Channels

### Top-Down: Gatekeeper Partnerships

High-volume connectors (like Mark, the pilot user) receive ~1,000 emails/week. They forward inbound to Evryn. Evryn identifies who's worth their time. The vast majority (~999 of 1,000) aren't the right *mutual* fit for that gatekeeper — but they're real people with real needs. They become full Evryn users.

**Gatekeeper framing:** The gatekeeper model is a *channel*, not an ownership structure. Evryn's obligation is to *each* user, not just to the gatekeeper. If Bob emails 20 gatekeepers who all use Evryn, each gatekeeper deserves the best match, but Bob deserves the best match regardless of which inbox surfaced him. The deal: "we will find you the *best mutual* matches" — not "you own your inbound." This framing naturally transitions to the future state where gatekeepers redirect inbound to Evryn directly.

### Bottom-Up: Whisper Cascade

Invite-only positioning: "An invite-only platform where you get introduced to people who can change your career — but only if someone vouches for you." This triggers status-driven demand: "Do you know Evryn? Who can get me an invite?" Frames access as status, and status as prelude to serendipity.

### Wave Strategy

Launch starts at "the bottom of the food chain" and moves upward across parallel tracks:
- **Actor track:** actors → casting directors → directors/producers → institutions
- **Production track:** crew → coordinators → producers → studios

Each wave is primed in advance: actors know casting directors are next; when casting arrives, all the talent is already on. This turns every new group into a gravity well for the next, minimizing customer acquisition cost. "We don't grow by blitzing. We grow by solving, proving, and being invited forward — circle by circle."

## Cast-Off Outreach

People who emailed a gatekeeper but weren't the right mutual fit didn't opt in to hearing from Evryn. However, they initiated contact with someone in Evryn's ecosystem. CAN-SPAM is navigable (requires opt-out, not prior opt-in for email).

**Framing:** "You reached out to [gatekeeper], who works with Evryn. They're not the right fit for this, but if you'd like, I'd be happy to help you find what you're looking for."

Consent framework for channels beyond email (SMS, etc.) needs legal guidance — see `docs/legal/clarifications-for-system-docs.md`.

## Growth Mechanics

**Quality over quantity.** Personal outreach and warm introductions, not cold ads. Each invite feels special because it is. Referrals, pre-purchases, and ownership (via crowdfunding) are part of the user journey but never as pressure — only at the right emotional moment.

**Growth is conversationally embedded.** The ideal landing page is "talk to Evryn." She pitches from the user's vantage point while demonstrating value.

### Referral Mechanics

Pre-launch: if you refer someone who becomes a paying customer, Evryn rewards you with Evryn Credit (non-monetary). Credit only unlocks after the referred user completes their first paid connection — rewards tied to real engagement. Post-launch: sharing should reflect belief in the product, not incentives.

### Evangelist Story Loops

When a user has a great experience, Evryn may ask: "Would you want to help others by sharing your story?" Stories appear on user's channels, Evryn's platforms, or woven into onboarding flows. Every story must reflect Evryn's tone: personal, humane, nuanced, emotionally honest. Users retain rights to their stories; licensing language needed in Terms.

## Key Messaging Themes

1. **The old way is broken** — dating apps string you along, professional networks are cold noise, gig platforms commoditize people, social media increases disconnection
2. **Resonance over resemblance** — deeper human matches, not superficial ones
3. **Users as owners** — literally and philosophically user-owned
4. **Trust and care** — would rather grow slowly with trust than rapidly with gimmicks
5. **A relationship, not an app** — using Evryn feels like interacting with a wise friend
6. **Share freely, she'll sort the signal** — you don't have to figure out who to trust

## Competitive Landscape

| Category | Current State | Evryn's Edge | Key Threats |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Film & Entertainment** | Fragmented, trust-starved, gatekept (Facebook groups, Stage32, StaffMeUp) | First to unify creative matchmaking under AI trust model. Justin's network as ignition. | LinkedIn targeting creatives; cultural pushback from gatekeepers |
| **Dating Apps** | Massive, churn-heavy, emotionally exhausted (Tinder, Hinge, Bumble) | No manipulation, no profiles, no swipes. Trust-first, outcome-focused. | Bumble pivoting into AI; Hinge copying outcome narrative |
| **Professional Networking** | Static, self-promotional, cold (LinkedIn, Lunchclub) | Actual introductions, double opt-in, multidimensional alignment. | LinkedIn builds real AI matchmaking |
| **Gig & Freelance** | Transactional, noisy, commoditized (Upwork, Fiverr, Uber) | Long-term trust loops. Match once, come back forever. | Upwork layering AI; Uber scaling personalization |
| **Social Media** | Massive, chaotic, wrong tool for connection (Facebook, Discord, Reddit) | Quiet, curated, personal. You don't scroll — you get introduced. | Meta releases "Connections AI"; Discord layers matchmaking |

### Infrastructure Licensing (Long Game)

If Evryn works, competitors may try to neutralize her. The architecture is designed to optionally license Evryn's matchmaking layer — letting aligned platforms embed her logic. "LinkedIn — now with Evryn intros." Strategic judo: turn competition into distribution.

> *Removed: month-by-month launch timeline targeting Dec 2025. Dates passed; being rebuilt as v0.2 pilot. See original Master Plan lines 921-1006.*

> *Removed: detailed outreach plan (PR strategy, community outreach at film festivals, influencer plan, ad spend approach). Being rebuilt for pilot phase. See original lines 1305-1337.*

> *Removed: scope compression/expansion triggers calibrated for Dec 2025 launch (runway thresholds, compute cost triggers, user count milestones). Core principle preserved: "The experience of meeting Evryn never gets compromised." See original lines 1130-1158.*

> *Removed: 12-month department plans with staffing timelines. Assumed human team pre-AI pivot. See original lines 1012-1127.*
