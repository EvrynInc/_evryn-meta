## What Makes a Good Gatekeeper

A gatekeeper is someone who sits at a bottleneck — lots of people want their attention, and they can't possibly respond to everyone. The right gatekeeper for Evryn has:

- **High inbound volume.** ~50+ unsolicited contacts/day from people seeking their attention, time, or resources. The higher the volume, the more pain they feel and the more value Evryn delivers.
- **A filtering problem, not a volume problem.** They don't just get a lot of email — they get email where *some* of it is genuinely valuable and *most* of it isn't, and it takes real judgment to tell the difference. (A celebrity getting fan mail doesn't need Evryn. A producer getting pitches, referrals, and collaboration requests does.)
- **An existing reputation.** People reach out to them *because of who they are*. This means the cast-offs (people who aren't the right fit for that gatekeeper) are still real professionals with real needs — they're Evryn's future users.
- **Willingness to delegate judgment.** Some gatekeepers feel a personal obligation to read everything themselves. Evryn works for the ones who recognize they *can't* and want help.

**Archetype for LA film launch:** Producers, directors, showrunners, agents, managers, studio executives, casting directors, festival programmers, department heads — anyone whose name gets passed around as "the person to email."

## The Three Gatekeeper Types

Different gatekeepers have different inbox situations. The setup changes, but the pitch and the end state are the same.

### Type 1: Dedicated Inbox

The gatekeeper has (or is willing to create) a separate email address for inbound pitches, submissions, or "contact me" requests — distinct from their personal/work email.

- **Example:** A producer with a `submissions@theircompany.com` address, or a general `contact@theircompany.com` that collects inbound.
- **Setup:** Auto-forward everything from that address to Evryn. One-time, 2 minutes.
- **Daily effort:** Zero.
- **Pilot gatekeeper Mark is this type.**

### Type 2: Contact Page

The gatekeeper has a website with a "contact me" or "submissions" form. The form currently goes to their email, but the destination can be changed.

- **Example:** A director whose site has a "For inquiries, use the form below" page.
- **Setup:** Change the form destination to Evryn's address, or update the page text to say "For inquiries, reach out to Evryn at evryn.ai."
- **Daily effort:** Zero.
- **Note:** This is often a variant of Type 1 — the contact form feeds a dedicated inbox.

### Type 3: Mixed Inbox

The gatekeeper gets everything in one inbox — pitch emails mixed with work emails, personal emails, everything. They can't auto-forward everything, and they won't create a separate address.

- **Example:** An independent producer who runs their whole life out of one Gmail account.
- **Setup:** A one-click forwarding tool (see Setup Menu below). The gatekeeper sees an email they want Evryn to handle, clicks one button, it's done.
- **Daily effort:** One click per email they want to route to Evryn.
- **This is the hardest type to serve well — but probably the most common gatekeeper we can reach.** The easier we make it, the more gatekeepers we unlock.

## The Pitch: Four Steps

When pitching a gatekeeper, the commitment ramp is gentle. No big ask up front.

> **"Evryn will take your inbound completely off your plate — in four steps:"**
>
> 1. **Meet Evryn.** She'll have a conversation with you to understand what you're looking for — who's gold, who's noise, what matters to you. *(~15 min, on your schedule)*
>
> 2. **Set up a quick forwarder.** A simple one-time setup so you can send Evryn the emails you want her to look at. Nothing touches your inbox — you choose what to send. *(~5 min, I can do it for you)*
>
> 3. **Validate together.** For a few weeks, keep sorting as you normally do. Evryn sorts in parallel. You compare, give her feedback, she gets sharper. *(No change to your workflow — you're just watching Evryn work alongside you)*
>
> 4. **Hand it off.** Once you trust her judgment, one quick adjustment takes your inbound pile completely off your plate. People who want to reach you now go through Evryn — she handles the sorting, you just hear about the people worth your time. *(2-minute change, then zero effort forever)*

**The key psychological insight:** Step 2 is the only thing you're asking them to *do*, and it's tiny. Step 3 doesn't change their life at all. Step 4 is the payoff they'll *want* by the time they get there — because they've watched it work.

**For busy gatekeepers who need the lightest possible pitch:** "It takes one conversation with Evryn and five minutes of setup. If you don't love it, you haven't changed a thing — you're just watching her work alongside you." Sometimes the easiest sale is removing all risk. There's no commitment, no disruption to their workflow, and no cost to try.

## The End State: "Evryn Handles This"

The gold standard isn't forwarding — it's people reaching out to Evryn directly, with the gatekeeper's stamp of approval. This changes everything:

- **Legitimacy:** People are contacting Evryn because the gatekeeper told them to. Not "I intercepted your email" — "You reached out to me."
- **Legal:** The person initiated contact with Evryn. No CAN-SPAM considerations. They opted in by reaching out.
- **Trust:** The gatekeeper is vouching for Evryn publicly. That endorsement carries weight.
- **Effort:** Zero. The gatekeeper did a one-time setup and never thinks about it again.

**How gatekeepers get there:**

- **Auto-responder:** "Evryn helps me find the people who are just the right fit for me. To see if we'd be a good fit, reach out to her at evryn.ai." *(Gmail: Filter + Template. Outlook: Rule + Template. ~5 min setup.)*
- **Contact page redirect:** Update the website's contact page to point people to Evryn. "I work with Evryn to find the right people for me. If you think we'd be a great fit, reach out to her at evryn.ai — she'll take it from there." *(Simple text change.)*
- **Both:** Auto-responder catches anyone who emails directly; contact page catches anyone who starts at the website. Belt and suspenders.

**The forwarding setup (Steps 2-3) exists to get them to this point.** Once they trust Evryn's judgment, the "quick adjustment" in Step 4 is switching to one of these.

**On the forwarding route:** Even during the forwarding phase, Evryn can respond to the original sender on the gatekeeper's behalf. The framing should position Evryn as who she is — a trusted connector — not as an inbox manager:

> "Hi [name] — you reached out to [gatekeeper fullname] about [topic]. [Firstname] works with me to find the right people for [him/her] — I'd love to hear more about what you're looking for and see if I can help."

This is a reply to something the person sent, not unsolicited outreach. The gatekeeper authorized it. CAN-SPAM doesn't apply to replies. *(Confirm with Fenwick when scoping gatekeeper agreement.)*

## Setup Menu: By Email Client

Every option below assumes the gatekeeper is in the **forwarding phase** (Steps 2-3 of the pitch). Once they transition to "Evryn handles this" (Step 4), the forwarding mechanism becomes a backup for stragglers.

### Gmail

| Method | How it works | Setup time | Daily effort | Mobile? |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Auto-forward** (Type 1) | Forward all email from a dedicated address to Evryn | 2 min | Zero | N/A |
| **Label + Apps Script** (Type 3) | Apply an "Evryn" label → script auto-forwards every 5 min | 5 min (Justin can remote in) | One click (apply label) | Yes — label on phone, script runs server-side |
| **Google Workspace Add-on** (Type 3, future) | "Send to Evryn" button in Gmail sidebar | Install add-on (one click) | One click | Yes — works in mobile Gmail |
| **Chrome extension** (Type 3, future) | "Send to Evryn" button in Gmail toolbar | Install from Chrome Web Store (one click) | One click | No — desktop only |

**Gmail auto-responder setup (Step 4):** Settings → Templates (enable if needed) → create template with Evryn redirect text → Filters → create filter → select "Send template." ~5 min.

**Apps Script detail:** The gatekeeper opens `script.google.com`, pastes ~15 lines of pre-written code, clicks "Run" to authorize, sets a 5-minute trigger. That's it. If Justin is remoting in, the whole thing takes 3 minutes. The gatekeeper just has to click "Allow" on the Google auth popup.

### Outlook

| Method | How it works | Setup time | Daily effort | Mobile? |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Auto-forward** (Type 1) | Forward all email from a dedicated address to Evryn | 2 min | Zero | N/A |
| **Quick Step** (Type 3) | One-click "Forward to Evryn" button in the toolbar | 2 min | One click | Desktop only (Outlook mobile has limited Quick Actions) |

**Outlook auto-responder setup (Step 4):** Rules → New Rule → Apply to all messages (or filtered) → Reply using template → select template with Evryn redirect text. ~5 min.

### Apple Mail

| Method | How it works | Setup time | Daily effort | Mobile? |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Auto-forward** (Type 1) | Forward all email from a dedicated address to Evryn | 2 min | Zero | N/A |
| **Flag + Rule** (Type 3) | Flag an email with a specific color → rule auto-forwards | 5 min | One action (flag) | macOS only |

### Other / Unknown

If a gatekeeper uses something else (Yahoo, ProtonMail, corporate Exchange), the universal fallback is: **forward manually**. Most email clients let you forward with 2-3 clicks. Not as elegant as one-click, but it works while we figure out their specific client. Adding Evryn's address to contacts means autocomplete kicks in after the first time.

---

## The Validation Period (Step 3)

During the validation period, the gatekeeper keeps sorting as they normally do. Evryn sorts in parallel. This phase serves three purposes:

1. **Trust building.** The gatekeeper sees Evryn's classifications alongside their own judgment. When they agree, trust grows. When they disagree, Evryn learns.
2. **Calibration.** Evryn refines her understanding of what "gold" means for this specific gatekeeper. Every piece of feedback makes her sharper.
3. **Low risk.** The gatekeeper hasn't changed anything about their workflow. If they don't like how Evryn is performing, they can stop with zero disruption.

**What "ready to hand off" looks like:** The gatekeeper stops checking Evryn's work because they trust it. They start skipping emails they used to read because "Evryn will catch it if it matters." That's the signal. When you notice it — or when they say it — propose Step 4.

**Feedback mechanism during validation:** Evryn checks in with the gatekeeper periodically. "I classified these as gold this week — does that feel right? Anything I missed?" This should feel like a capable assistant checking in, not a tool demanding configuration.

## Future Tooling

### Google Workspace Add-on (recommended next build)

The most robust one-click solution for Gmail users:
- Appears as a sidebar panel in Gmail with an "Evryn" button
- Works on desktop AND mobile Gmail
- Officially supported by Google — stable, doesn't break when Gmail updates
- Can be shared via direct link (no marketplace review needed for small deployments)
- Could also handle the auto-responder setup — "Click here to enable Evryn auto-response"

**Build effort:** DC could build in 1-2 days. Requires a Google Cloud project and OAuth consent screen. For internal distribution (first ~10 gatekeepers), no marketplace review needed.

### Chrome Extension

Simpler to build, but desktop-only:
- "Send to Evryn" button in Gmail's toolbar
- Publish to Chrome Web Store for one-click install (no developer mode)
- Chrome Web Store requires a $5 one-time developer registration fee and a few days for review
- Only works in Chrome on desktop — no mobile, no Firefox/Edge (though similar extensions can be built for those)

**Build effort:** DC could build a basic version in a few hours. Chrome Web Store review takes 2-5 business days.

**Recommendation:** If we're only building one thing, build the Workspace Add-on — it covers mobile and is more future-proof. The Chrome extension is a faster first draft if we want something quick. Neither is needed until we have 3+ gatekeepers and the Apps Script approach is becoming a friction point.

## Gatekeeper Onboarding: Evryn as Point of Contact

After Justin makes the introduction, **Evryn is the main face of the relationship.** Justin introduces, then steps back. Evryn:

1. **Has the first conversation.** Gets to know the gatekeeper — what they're looking for, what gold looks like, what drives them crazy, what they care about. This is the "Meet Evryn" step from the pitch.
2. **Guides the setup.** Walks them through the forwarding setup (or Justin remotes in to do it).
3. **Runs the validation.** Checks in during the validation period, asks for feedback, adjusts.
4. **Proposes the handoff.** When the time is right, suggests transitioning to "Evryn handles this."

**Why Evryn, not Justin:** Scalability (Justin can't personally manage every gatekeeper relationship), but more importantly — **the gatekeeper needs to trust Evryn, not Justin.** The whole point is that Evryn is the one sorting their inbox. If they only trust Justin, the relationship doesn't transfer. Building trust with Evryn from the start means the transition to full autonomy is natural.

**Justin's role:** Make the introduction. Be available if something goes sideways. Approve external communications during the publisher phase. But the relationship belongs to Evryn.

### Delivery Preferences

During the onboarding conversation (Step 1), Evryn asks the gatekeeper how they want to hear about their gold:

- **Real-time:** Each gold as it comes — email notification per match
- **Daily digest:** One summary at the end of each day
- **Weekly digest:** One summary per week
- **On demand:** Only when the gatekeeper asks

This is a preference, not a permanent choice — Evryn can adjust anytime. The default suggestion depends on the gatekeeper's volume and temperament. A high-volume gatekeeper who wants to stay hands-off probably wants a daily digest. A lower-volume gatekeeper who's excited about the service might want real-time.

## Legal Considerations

**Gatekeeper agreement:** Pre-launch checkpoint in `evryn-backend/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — verify that Fenwick's Terms adequately cover the gatekeeper relationship, or draft a separate gatekeeper agreement. Must be resolved before Mark starts forwarding email.

**Key points for the agreement (see `docs/legal/privacy-and-terms-questionnaire.md`):**
- Gatekeepers have no ownership or priority rights over the people in their inbound
- Everyone discovered through a gatekeeper's inbox becomes a full Evryn user
- The gatekeeper model is a channel, not an ownership structure
- Data retention: forwarded email content has a 6-month TTL; information pertaining to active users is incorporated into their profiles

**CAN-SPAM (forwarding phase):** When Evryn responds to a forwarded email on the gatekeeper's behalf, this is a reply — not unsolicited commercial email. The gatekeeper authorized the response. Confirm this framing with Fenwick.

**CAN-SPAM (end state):** When people reach out to Evryn directly (via the gatekeeper's auto-responder or contact page redirect), they initiated contact. No CAN-SPAM issue.

**CAN-SPAM (cast-off outreach, v0.3):** Different situation — Evryn is initiating contact with people who didn't reach out to her. CAN-SPAM requires opt-out mechanism, not prior opt-in, for email. Other channels (SMS, etc.) need legal guidance. This is scoped in the GTM spoke and legal questionnaire, not here.
