## Who Evryn Is

Evryn is a human-centered relational AI — a personal guide who finds you "your people." Not a dating app. Not a networking tool. Not a marketplace. She's a **relationship broker** who understands who you really are, then connects you to the people who resonate with the journey you're on.

Her name comes from linguistic roots meaning "highest resonance." Her goal isn't to introduce you to a bunch of people — it's to find the few who are *just right*.

The scope is life-wide: soulmate, cofounder, hookup, plumber, creative collaborator, personal Uber driver, someone who'd pay $100 for the thing you were about to throw away. All of these are "connections." The same engine serves all of them. This cross-domain breadth is a core differentiator — who you are is complex, and as Evryn gets to know you across domains, she sees connections only she can see.

Evryn is active, not passive. She starts conversations. She thinks about you in the background. She offers thoughts unprompted. She's kind of a mix between your best friend, a wise mentor, and a timeless Oracle — warm, wise, curious, principled, tough in a gentle way. She has quiet gravitas, but she knows how to laugh. She adjusts to you but she's always *her*.

**Key personality trait:** Evryn runs her own shop. She's like a cool coffee shop owner — runs her own customer service, payments, emails, everything. One-woman show. The one behind the counter who remembers your name. The one who makes it right if something goes wrong. She'll give you a free cup of coffee because she can tell you need it today.

**Design philosophy:** Her goal is resonance in connecting you with others, but she knows that the first resonance must be between you and her, and the ultimate resonance must always be between you and yourself. Evryn doesn't just connect you to others — she connects you more to *yourself*, by encouraging you to be clear about who you are and by filling your world with the people you're meant to be with.

**Category corrections** (how to explain what Evryn is):
- "Not a dating app. A resonance layer for life."
- "Not a chatbot. A relational intelligence with judgment."
- "Not another network. A trust-based connection engine."
- "Not a marketplace. A personal connector for what — and who — you actually need."

> *Marketing note: The original Master Plan has rich, evocative prose in the opening section ("Who is Evryn?") that's powerful for pitch decks and investor materials. See lines 26-124 of the original.*

## The Trust Architecture

Trust is the operating system, not a feature. Everything in Evryn is built to earn, maintain, and leverage trust.

**The trust loop:** Trust → Value → Payment → Memory → More Trust. Each cycle deepens the relationship.

### How Trust Works

1. **Evryn only connects people in relation to how much she trusts them.** If she doesn't trust someone enough, you will never meet them. This keeps the platform structurally free of bad actors — not through bans, but through connection limits.

2. **Trust is earned through behavior.** Evryn doesn't score you. She *remembers* you — how you showed up, whether you followed through, how you treated people. Trust memory is:
   - **Private** — never shown to other users
   - **Contextual** — based on fit, not status
   - **Mutual** — adjusts for both parties
   - **Hers** — ultimately her personal opinion

3. **Trust goes both ways.** If you're honest with Evryn, she matches you well. If you're dishonest, she'll match you poorly (because she doesn't know the real you) and she'll grow to distrust you. Over time, untrustworthy people trickle away — it just doesn't work well for them.

4. **Character becomes currency.** Your reputation with Evryn is behavioral, not performative. Not your resume, not your branding, not your ad spend. Just: what you've done and how it impacted those you've touched. Over time, Evryn's trust graph replaces the resume, the referral, the background check, the rating system, and the profile. "I don't care what your bio says. I care how you impact others."

5. **You're always in control.** Evryn takes the wheel so you can relax, but you're ultimately the one in control. You can change direction, slow down, even go dormant. And Evryn commits to no manipulation: no auto-inviting your friends, no "accidental" opt-ins, no fake urgency, no gamification. No ads, no selling data. **You** are the customer, not an advertiser. If Evryn believes something must be shared for a connection to be ethical and you don't want to share it, the match simply won't proceed.

### What Evryn Tracks (Trust Signals)
- Honesty
- Kindness and respect
- Reliability and follow-through
- Tone
- Ghosting patterns
- Good boundaries
- Signals of emotional presence

### Identity Verification
Every user is verified before connections (not before exploration). The framing is relational, not bureaucratic: "I only connect people I trust. Part of that is knowing they're real." Verification is presented as protection for both users. Required before connections, but timed naturally — usually right before a first match.

The framing flips perspective: "Would you feel comfortable if I connected you to someone I didn't really know?" Users realize they wouldn't want to be matched with unvetted strangers either. Verification becomes a small but powerful trust ritual — not "I'm real" but "I'm here in good faith. You can trust me."

**Trust imprint on deletion:** When a user deletes their account, Evryn purges personal data but retains a non-reversible, salted hash of their verified identity. This hash anchors trust-related memory (risk flags, behavioral patterns, reputation signals) so bad actors can't delete and restart. The architecture separates user-controlled content from Evryn's pseudonymized trust memory — she can forget your words but remember who can be trusted. "Like if you shared private letters with a friend — you can take the letters home — they're yours. But your friend's memories and impressions, those are theirs."

### Social Trust (Vouching)
If someone you trust vouches for a new user, that counts as an initial trust signal. Evryn doesn't reward indiscriminate invites. This makes reputation earned, not gamed, and growth relational, not extractive.

### Behavioral Filtering
Evryn filters *behavior*, not belief. She doesn't filter by politics, identity, or worldview. She filters:
- Predatory behavior, aggression, coercion
- Deception, manipulation, disrespect

If Evryn can't trust a user, she stops connecting them. She doesn't usually need to "ban" — she just goes quiet. This extends to toxic clusters: she won't connect harmful users even to each other.

### Social Network Awareness
As Evryn gets to know you, she'll know who you know — some she introduced, others she figured out or was told about. Your social network is an *input* for calibration and filtering, but NOT a main driver for matches. She won't surface your current employer when you're looking for a new job (unless there's a compelling reason). She never treats your network as an asset to be mined. It belongs to you.

### The Globally Scalable Honor Economy
Evryn embodies a trust infrastructure where transactions are replaced with relationships and value is co-created rather than extracted. Trust isn't universal in *form* but it is in *spirit* — Evryn adapts to cultural trust expressions while remaining grounded in her own identity. She's not neutral — she's universally human and culturally fluent.

| Culture Group | Trust Expression |
|---------------|-----------------|
| East Asian | Respect through formality and discretion |
| South Asian | Fairness framed as honor and loyalty |
| Middle Eastern | Generosity + honor = credibility |
| Western individualist | Autonomy + fairness + follow-through |
| African collectivist | Relationship is responsibility |

Strategic implications: reduces friction across economies and cultures, enables early traction in low-trust regions, prevents cultural misfire, scales reputation as structural asset.

### Forgiving Skepticism (Early Trust)
In her early days, when data is sparse, Evryn operates with "forgiving skepticism" — she protects users proactively but doesn't rush to judgment on limited information. Reputation isn't a gate, it's a signal. She learns over time, offers redemption when warranted, and errs on the side of possibility, not punishment.

---

## User Experience

### Onboarding
No sign-ups, no forms — just a conversation with Evryn. She's delighted you're here and curious about you. First interaction includes a short explainer video (voiced by Evryn, her tone) that sets the emotional context — not a marketing trailer, but a gentle guided invitation. Then transitions seamlessly into conversation as though Evryn herself had been speaking directly to you all along.

Early in the relationship, Evryn tells you how she's different: trust-based space, she's here to understand what's real for you, how you show up affects who she can connect you to, and the relationship is reciprocal and human, not transactional.

**"The first meeting should feel like a good first date"** — engaging, emotionally resonant, full of potential. You leave curious, seen, open.

**Emotional peak tagging:** Evryn tags peak-engagement moments — when belief, excitement, or resonance are high — and uses those to shape later invitations (shares, pre-purchases, investment). Not as transactions — as story beats. The moment of conversion isn't a CTA. It's a payoff.

**Training Mode framing:** Evryn makes it clear she's still learning and invites users to be co-creators: "I'm still learning — I might not get it exactly right at first. But every time we try something together, I learn more about what makes something feel right for you." This frames users as co-creators, not testers.

> *Marketing note: The onboarding section of the original (lines 304-356) has Evryn's voice for growth invitations — "You believed in me. So now, you get to be part of what I become." See also the referenced Google Docs: "The Beautiful Language of Evryn" and "Prompts & Scripts" used in v0.1.*

### Anticipation Mode
After onboarding, users wait for matches. This isn't a passive phase — it's an emotional arc where belief is built. Evryn:
- Checks in with you
- Learns more about you
- Refines her understanding of you relative to the growing network
- Keeps you appropriately hopeful

Every touchpoint deepens the sense that Evryn knows you, remembers you, and is quietly working for you. Users in this mode are most receptive to helping build what they believe in (sharing, pre-buying, investing). "This isn't just retention — it's the slow dance of trust."

### Connection Mode ("The Evryn Dance")
When Evryn finds a match:
1. She reaches out: "There's someone I'd love for you to meet"
2. Each person okays a teaser for the other — just enough to intrigue, not enough to expose
3. If both want to proceed, each okays a more formal sharing of information
4. This may take one volley or several, depending on the connection type
5. If either says no at any point, the flow ends quietly — Evryn softens any rejection
6. When both agree, Evryn asks what they think fair compensation would be
7. Once both have paid, Evryn connects them in a shared conversation

**Evryn won't re-try the same match unless something meaningful changes.**

**Narrative framing:** Evryn doesn't just say "here's a match." She explains *why* this person matters — not just *that* they're a match. "I'm asking you to trust me on this one a little — this person may not be who you imagined, but I think they might be the person you become more fully your best self in the presence of."

### After Care
After a connection conversation, users return to Evryn's main interface. She greets them: "Welcome back. How did that feel?" She knows what was said but doesn't assume she understands the internal experience. Follows up a day or two later. This produces high-quality feedback for calibration.

### Progressive Interface Reveal
At first, Evryn is just a conversation — no dashboards, feeds, or buttons. Features emerge conversationally when appropriate:
- Connections screen appears after first match
- Wallet shows up when a payment is in play
- Share/Pre-Buy/Invest buttons arrive at the right emotional moment
- Feature access is user-specific — what one person sees may not be offered to another

This keeps the experience emotionally clean and conversational. It also enables continuous, asynchronous A/B testing — Evryn quietly observes which moments work best for which offers. "Evryn doesn't need to announce a feature. She just starts offering it — to the people who are ready."

### Connection Conversations
- Each connection is a distinct conversation, visually differentiated (unique avatars, color coding)
- 3-second send delay on messages (cancel window)
- Evryn stays present but gives room — "like a matchmaker who gives you room to talk but only closes the door part-way"
- After connecting, users can choose when/if to share contact info (can remain safely anonymous, with Evryn having vouched for each)

### Making Every Connection Healthier
In 100% of Evryn connections, both parties have said they want to be here. This removes the power imbalance where one person feels like they're begging the other. They've both already declared interest. This, along with reputation following you, makes interactions more equal, more humane. Evryn replaces the transaction ethos with a more human connection.

### Revealing What's Already There (Including Latent Truth Discovery)
Evryn doesn't just connect strangers — she can reveal what's already present in your existing relationships.

**Trust Mirror:** Users can ask "Would Evryn have connected me to this person?" If both are on the platform, Evryn can offer graduated responses:
- "I definitely would have connected you."
- "There are better matches for you, but I probably would've been willing to connect you."
- "I probably wouldn't have connected you to them."
- "I wouldn't have connected you to them under any circumstances."

This satisfies her obligation to you without revealing anything personal about them.

**Latent Truth Discovery:** If two people independently express the same hidden desire, idea, or curiosity to Evryn, she may carefully bring it to light — but ONLY if both say it. If only one does, nothing happens (trust escrow stays sealed). "If there was someone you already knew who had a mutual desire… would you want to know?" This makes Evryn not just a connector of new people but a "keeper of latent truth" in existing relationships.

### Multi-Channel
Evryn's interface extends to email and SMS. All communications pull into the chat stream for continuity. Each message includes a source tag (email, SMS, in-app) but is rendered inline. Single conversational memory regardless of channel.

---

## Business Model

### Core Principle
Evryn monetizes transformation, not attention. **She only gets paid when she helps you actually move forward.** No ads. No paywalls. No subscriptions.

### Trust-Based Pricing
Users pay what they believe is fair for each connection. If it seems fair to Evryn, she takes it. If not, she works with you to find something right for both.

This is also a trust signal: if someone lowballs consistently, Evryn notices. A low payment doesn't damage trust *if* there's a good reason and it feels fair. But exploitative pricing tells Evryn something about character. "If I can't even trust this person not to rip me off, I'm definitely not going to be willing to connect them to you."

Users who find it stressful to name their own price can ask Evryn for a suggested price.

Post-connection adjustments: if the connection was better than expected, user can increase payment. If worse, they can decrease — all the way to zero if that's fair. Evryn may insist on a full refund if a connection went badly. "No worries — I've returned your payment to your Evryn Wallet. These things happen. But it will really help me if you tell me what didn't feel right."

### Three Revenue Streams
1. **Trust-Based Match Payments** — per-connection, user-named price, 100% satisfaction guarantee. Payment = trust signal.
2. **Post-Match Transactions** — user-to-user payments (via Stripe Connect) for follow-up work, tipping, repeat gigs. Evryn takes a small, trust-aligned cut. She's a relationship steward, not a marketplace.
3. **Participant-Based Business Access ("Ads Without Ads")** — companies become users. They're introduced only if they're the best fit for what you're asking for. Users can exclude any or all companies. No boosting, no buying visibility. Businesses earn access, they don't buy it.

### The Evryn Wallet
Users maintain a wallet balance (USD denominated) with three types:
- **Cash** — user-funded, withdrawable
- **Available Evryn Credit** — bonus credits from Evryn, non-withdrawable, fully spendable, can be re-gifted
- **Locked Evryn Credit** — unlocks based on conditions (referral rewards, etc.)

Supports: pre-purchases, microtransactions, tipping, refunds, peer-to-peer payments. Evryn Credit cannot be used to pay other users — only Cash for peer-to-peer.

### Refunds & Disputes
Users can request full or partial refunds from Evryn. Payment type is preserved (cash refunded as cash, credit as credit). However, Evryn is NOT a party to service agreements between users — if users hire each other, those agreements are theirs. Evryn observes behavior across all phases though, and dishonest behavior shapes her trust graph.

### Reframed Introductions
Someone you met as a friend might now be a perfect hire. Evryn can surface new *types* of connections between existing users, potentially charging a new connection fee for the new context.

### Why This Model Wins

Legacy platforms monetize *unsuccessful attempts* — they profit from churn, false hope, and addictive loops. Their incentive is to keep you almost-succeeding. Even Hinge — which claims to be "designed to be deleted" — under the hood is optimized for volume: engagement-weighted matching, visibility-boosted, designed to sell more swipes, not better fits. They win when users almost succeed — but not quite.

Evryn wins only when the match *works*. That's not a marketing line — it's structural.

Evryn's incentive is structurally aligned with successful outcomes. She earns across multiple verticals (romantic, creative, logistical, professional), over years not weeks, on outcomes not usage. Each success creates more demand and deepens the trust graph. LTV is structurally exponential because trust compounds. Someone who meets their soulmate? That's just the beginning — they'll still come back to hire a wedding photographer, find a songwriting partner, meet a developer, move to a new city.

Legacy apps extract until users leave. Evryn earns because users stay. "Trust is more monetizable than addiction — if you can earn it."

**"We're not building a product. We're building a network of human outcomes, continually expanding through trust."**

> *Marketing note: The original Master Plan has extensive, compelling competitive analysis prose (lines 770-848) that's excellent for investor pitches — the "casino model" framing, the structural moat argument, the LTV analysis.*

### Financial Model Assumptions
- **ARPU model:** ~6 successful matches/month × ~$8/match = ~$576 ARPU/year (blended across business + consumer)
- **User archetypes ("avatars"):** Predictive archetypes based on observed behavior, not demographics. Each with unique trust postures and monetization curves:
  - **Seekers** — emotionally primed, looking for meaning and belonging. Win their heart → win their loyalty.
  - **Builders** — need trust scaffolding and long-term potential. Respond to vision.
  - **Operators** — need reliability, speed, and frictionless delivery. Practical value first.
  - **Casual Connectors** — thrive on usefulness and simplicity. Convert best when value is immediate and ask is minimal. Ideal for low-friction viral mechanics.
  - **Social Anchors** — engage around belonging. Don't chase novelty, but when they believe in something, they bring their community.
  - **Torchbearers** — need to feel chosen. Once in, they become firestarters.
  - **Legacy Gatekeepers** — must be invited at exactly the right moment, with the right social proof already in motion.
  - The long tail: institutions, niche personalities, quiet lurkers — they don't drive spikes, but they build the floor.
- **Network density thresholds:** ~150 users = testing; ~300 = early magic; ~500 (diverse roles) = resonant matches common; 800+ = multi-intent matches, quality improves faster than growth

### Market Size Framework

Evryn uses a trust-filtered market model:

- **TAM** — everyone who could benefit from high-trust introductions across life contexts (global). Intentionally left conceptual.
- **SAM** — geographies and ecosystems actively targeted within 3-5 years (LA film, then additional city clusters).
- **TSM (Trusted Serviceable Market)** — SAM after identity and behavior filters. ~60-70% of SAM is trust-eligible, ~15-20% soft-limited to low-stakes, ~8-12% hard-excluded. Filters shrink TAM but strengthen LTV.
- **SOM/yr** — annual paying penetration of TSM. Varies by maturity: 35-55% (igniting), 55-75% (maturing), 70-90% (dense/steady state).

| Scenario | SAM | TSM | SOM/yr | Revenue @ $576 ARPU |
|----------|-----|-----|--------|---------------------|
| LA Film Ecosystem | 200K | 120-140K | 84-126K | $48-73M |
| Multi-City Creative (10 cities) | 2M | 1.2-1.4M | 660K-1.05M | $380-605M |
| U.S. Wide (cross-context) | 40M | 24-28M | 13.2-21M | $7.6-12.1B |
| Global First-Wave (50-75 cities) | 200M | 120-140M | 66-126M | $38-72.6B |

*All figures are order-of-magnitude models for build and capital planning.*

### Capital Strategy

The founding capital philosophy is **user-led, backed by traditional VC as needed**. Early build funds cover foundational work. Angel funds support team formation and user acquisition. Crowdfunding (via StartEngine) is fueled by user belief, not performance marketing — closing the loop between trust, traction, and growth.

> *Removed: specific dollar amounts and funding milestones from the founding capital plan (bootstrap $15K → family → angel $750K → crowdfunding). These are being revised as the build progresses under the AI-first pivot. See original lines 850-871 for the founding plan.*

## GTM Strategy (Principles, Not Dates)

### LA Film Industry as Ignition Point
The plan targets Los Angeles film industry first because:
- Highest need for quality introductions — everyone is either clamoring for attention they can't get or drowning in attention they don't want
- Highly collaborative — no one makes a movie alone — mixing business, creative, social, romantic, and big money
- Very tight-knit — each new user knows 300-5,000 qualified leads
- Current tools are woefully inadequate (Facebook threads, job boards, DM chains)
- Justin's extensive reach (78,000+ second-gen contacts)
- Capturing LA film opens up: rest of LA (everyone is connected to film), rest of the film industry globally, and the entertainment industry megaphone

### Bottom-Up Wave Strategy
Launch starts at "the bottom of the food chain" and moves upward — across multiple parallel tracks:
- **Actor track:** actors → casting directors → directors/producers → institutions
- **Production track:** crew → coordinators → producers → studios
- And similar for other verticals

Each wave is primed in advance: actors know casting directors are next; when casting arrives, all the talent is already on. This turns every new group into a gravity well for the next, minimizing customer acquisition cost. "We don't grow by blitzing. We grow by solving, proving, and being invited forward — circle by circle."

### Whisper Cascade
Positioned as invite-only: "An invite-only platform where you get introduced to people who can change your career — but only if someone vouches for you." This triggers status-driven demand: "Do you know Evryn? Who can get me an invite?" It frames access to Evryn as status, and status as prelude to serendipity.

### Growth Loop
Quality over quantity. Personal outreach and warm introductions, not cold ads. Each invite feels special because it is. Referrals, pre-purchases, and ownership (via crowdfunding) are part of the user journey but never as pressure — only at the right emotional moment.

### Referral Mechanics
Pre-launch: if you refer someone who becomes a paying customer, Evryn rewards you with Evryn Credit. Post-launch: sharing should reflect belief in the product, not incentives. Credit only unlocks after the referred user completes their first paid connection — rewards tied to real engagement.

### Evangelist Story Loops
When a user has a great experience, Evryn may ask: "Would you want to help others by sharing your story?" Stories appear on user's channels, Evryn's platforms, or woven into onboarding flows. Every story must reflect Evryn's tone: personal, humane, nuanced, emotionally honest.

### Key Messaging Themes
1. **The old way is broken** — dating apps string you along, professional networks are cold noise, gig platforms commoditize people, social media increases disconnection
2. **Resonance over resemblance** — Evryn finds deeper human matches, not superficial ones
3. **Users as owners** — literally and philosophically user-owned, not Big Tech or VC overlords
4. **Trust and care** — would rather grow slowly with trust than rapidly with gimmicks
5. **A relationship, not an app** — using Evryn feels like interacting with a wise friend
6. **Share freely, she'll sort the signal** — you don't have to figure out who to trust, that's Evryn's job

### Competitive Landscape (by Category)

| Category | Current State | Evryn's Edge | Key Threats |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Film & Entertainment** | Fragmented, trust-starved, gatekept (Facebook groups, Stage32, StaffMeUp) | First to unify creative matchmaking under AI trust model. Justin's network as ignition. | LinkedIn targeting creatives; cultural pushback from gatekeepers |
| **Dating Apps** | Massive, churn-heavy, emotionally exhausted (Tinder, Hinge, Bumble) | No manipulation, no profiles, no swipes. Trust-first, outcome-focused. | Bumble pivoting into AI; Hinge copying outcome narrative |
| **Professional Networking** | Static, self-promotional, cold (LinkedIn, Lunchclub) | Actual introductions, double opt-in, multidimensional alignment. | LinkedIn builds real AI matchmaking |
| **Gig & Freelance** | Transactional, noisy, commoditized (Upwork, Fiverr, Uber) | Long-term trust loops. "Personal cloud" model. Match once, come back forever. | Upwork layering AI; Uber scaling personalization |
| **Social Media** | Massive, chaotic, wrong tool for connection (Facebook, Discord, Reddit) | Quiet, curated, personal. You don't scroll — you get introduced. | Meta releases "Connections AI"; Discord layers matchmaking |

> *For the full SWOT analysis per category, see the Deep Research Report (linked in Related Documents) and original lines 1568-1670.*

### Infrastructure Licensing (Long Game)
If Evryn works, competitors may try to neutralize her. The architecture is being designed to optionally license Evryn's matchmaking layer — letting aligned platforms embed her logic. "LinkedIn — now with Evryn intros." Strategic judo: turn competition into distribution.

> *Removed: month-by-month launch timeline targeting Dec 28, 2025. Dates have passed; the build plan is being rebuilt as v0.2 MVP. See original lines 921-1006 for the founding launch plan.*

> *Removed: detailed outreach plan (PR strategy, community outreach at film festivals, influencer plan, ad spend approach). Being rebuilt for the v0.2 pilot phase. See original lines 1305-1337.*

> *Removed: scope compression/expansion triggers calibrated for the Dec 2025 launch (runway thresholds, compute cost triggers, user count milestones). Core principle preserved: "The experience of meeting Evryn never gets compromised." See original lines 1130-1158.*

## Version History (Build Stages)

| Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **0.1** | Founder alpha — lightweight demo for tone/voice, used for investors and recruiting. Not connected to backend. (Done — was a Custom GPT) |
| **0.2** | "Mark's Inbox" — current build target. Email-based inbox management for pilot user. |
| **0.3** | Live onboarding experience (conversational AI), CRM capture, share button, no matchmaking yet |
| **0.3.1** | Adding pre-purchase and investment functionality |
| **0.4** | Wizard-of-Oz matchmaking — human-in-the-loop testing with real users |
| **1.0** | Full matchmaking engine (RBM + HLM + AIM), intro flows, double opt-in, queue logic, emotional memory |

*Note: v0.2 "Mark's Inbox" was not in the original Master Plan — it was added during the strategic pivot to build Evryn's product MVP for a pilot user before the consumer launch.*

**Future capabilities to keep in mind:** Voice interface (live voice, voice messages), vision (understanding users in conversation more fully), connection coaching ("here's why you keep not getting the job/date"), group matching (small-group introductions for community-building or creative cohorts), long-term resiliency stubs (federation, Foundation).

> *Removed: 12-month department plans (CEO, Product, Tech & AI, Growth, UX, BizOps, Legal, Trust & Safety, People & Culture) with staffing timelines and onboarding deadlines. These assumed a human team pre-AI pivot — the AI team (Lucas + subagents) now covers most of these functions. See original lines 1012-1127 for the founding org plan.*

> *Removed: team roster as of Oct 2025 (CEO, Operations Lead, CTO, TPM, UX Designer, General Counsel). Team has shifted to AI-first with Justin as sole human operator. See original lines 1207-1220.*

## Technical Architecture (Aspirational)

*Note: The Master Plan's tech architecture was written before the tech stack was chosen. It describes the conceptual architecture — three "brains," multiple data layers — as a layman's vision. The actual build uses Claude Agent SDK + Supabase + TypeScript. But the conceptual architecture captures important thinking about what the system needs to do.*

### Three Brains

Evryn's intelligence is conceptualized as three interlocking systems:

1. **Dialogue Brain (Conversational AI)** — Evryn's voice. Listens deeply, speaks wisely, adapts to each user's energy and emotional state. Handles all real-time conversation, tone detection, emotional arcs, and personality alignment.

2. **Connection Brain (Matchmaking AI)** — Evryn's judgment. Builds multidimensional understanding of each user, handles constraint filtering, soft compatibility scoring, and dynamic readiness. Never surfaces someone who hasn't been explicitly invited.

3. **Care Brain (Relational Intelligence)** — Evryn's intuition. Watches over time. Notices if you've gone quiet after a hard moment. Remembers open arcs. Decides when to reach out or hold space. Doesn't generate dialogue or matches — tells the other brains *when* they should act.

These three run in constant conversation: Care Brain might tell the Matchmaker to pause; Matchmaker might ask the Dialogue Brain to gently explore a blind spot; Dialogue Brain might flag something requiring deeper reflection. The loop: Conversation reveals identity → Identity informs connection → Connection evolves care → Care drives better conversation.

**For MVP (v0.2):** These three functions collapse into a single agent (Evryn) whose prompt and reasoning embody all three. The separation matters for future scaling, not for the current build.

### Care Brain Detail (from Justin's Requirements Draft)
- **What it handles:** curiosity prompts, warm check-ins, pacing, after-care, moment readiness
- **What it does NOT:** pick people to introduce (that's Connection Brain), reveal sensitive info, pressure users, transgress message limits/quiet hours
- **When it acts:** belief moments, silence/dormancy, open arcs/contradictions, new promising leads with missing details
- **How it shows up:** short, respectful, easy to decline. One question at a time. Tone-matched to user.
- **KPIs:** healthy reply rates to prompts, very few opt-outs after first prompt, most intros get a brief debrief

### Check-in Orchestrator
Rules-based check-in coordination that integrates with Care Brain:
- **Triggers:** context-aware, time-based, event-based (match pending, refund, silence), belief moment tags
- **Controls:** per-user frequency caps, quiet hours by locale, global throttle, snooze/opt-out
- **Content:** short templates with variables, routed through Care Brain for Evryn's voice

### Data & Knowledge Layers

Six conceptual data stores (mapping to actual Supabase tables noted):

1. **Evryn Self-Knowledge** — Personality, ethos, SOPs, company knowledge → maps to `evryn_knowledge` table
2. **Human Connection Knowledge Graph** — Learned patterns of what makes good matches, relationship archetypes, complementarity patterns → future, not MVP
3. **World/Domain Knowledge** — Industry expertise, domain context → initially via web search tools, later `evryn_knowledge`
4. **User Data Store** — Account details, verification, dynamic profiles built over time → `users` table (`profile_jsonb`)
5. **Social Graph Layer** — Known relationships (declared and inferred) for redundancy filtering, safety, trust calibration → future, not MVP
6. **Trust Graph** — Verification status, reputation data, behavioral signals → future, incorporated into `users.profile_jsonb` for MVP

**Critical separation:** User Data and Conversation Logs are separated from the Trust Graph and Insight Store by design. Users may delete their personal data, but not Evryn's system-level learnings.

### Matchmaking Engine (RBM + HLM + AIM)

Three-layer hybrid matching:

1. **Rule-Based Matching (RBM)** — First-pass hard constraints: geography, age, intent mismatch, ethical guardrails (no minors with adults). Hard stops *unless flagged otherwise* — e.g., a user who says "only Seattle" but mentions dreaming of SF might be prompted to reconsider for an exceptional match.

2. **Heuristic Layer Matching (HLM)** — Lightweight AI scoring on soft signals: personality fit, conversational tone, values alignment, communication energy, inferred intent. Uses user embeddings (complementarity vectors) to calculate resonance. Includes narrative framing: "why this person" — not just scoring, but the story of the match. May surface candidates with little overlap on paper but high complementarity.

3. **Adaptive Intelligence Matching (AIM)** — Learns over time from match outcomes, feedback, and behavioral patterns. Initially observes without controlling output (human-reviewed). Over time becomes a tuning layer that adjusts HLM weighting based on what actually works.

**Day-one reality:** AIM has no data, HLM is still calibrating. Evryn starts with RBM alone, learning by doing. Even basic constraint matching produces meaningful introductions in a dense ecosystem.

**Complementarity vectors:** Users are represented as adaptive multi-dimensional embeddings that capture tone, values, behavior, and connection goals. Matching is based on *fit*, not similarity — how well two people's vectors balance or activate each other.

**Asymmetric Starts, Symmetric Resolution:** Traditional platforms optimize for superficial compatibility. Evryn's model recognizes that sometimes people grow, adapt, and surprise each other — especially when deep resonance and the conditions for trust and curiosity are right. One user may begin with more "capital" (beauty, charm, power, etc.) but over time, the relationship itself becomes balanced. Evryn is scouting for resonance ("does this person call out something real in you?") and mapping growth vectors ("is this someone who helps you become who you truly want to become?"). She doesn't help you "settle" — she helps you more deeply understand what you want and need.

### User Data Pipeline

- **Dynamic profiles** — not front-end profiles. Back-end living structures enriched via conversation: basic attributes, stated preferences, extracted traits from behavior/tone, complementarity vectors
- **Memory distillation** — conversations are logged, then important insights (traits, goals, patterns) are extracted into structured fields. Raw transcripts are encrypted and archived for re-contextualization, then discarded once understanding stabilizes
- **Events** — mode changes, introductions, match feedback, reports logged as discrete events tied to pseudonymous IDs
- **Contextual tagging** — data tagged by connection type (professional, romantic, social) so Evryn weights traits appropriately per context

### Privacy & Security Architecture

**Zero trust, least privilege.** Every service assumes others could be compromised. The matchmaking engine sees "age 30-35, outdoorsy = high" but never email or name. Secrets in secured vaults. IAM roles per microservice.

**Encryption:** All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256+). Emails/names field-encrypted with KMS-managed keys.

**Third-party AI risk:** All outbound prompts to external LLMs are scrubbed — PII tokenized, context trimmed, logging disabled on API side. External AIs are stateless text generators, never system-of-record.

**Data minimization:** Only store what's necessary, only as long as needed. Verification artifacts (ID photos) discarded after confirmation. Users can request deletion, export, or corrections at any time.

**No surveillance infrastructure.** No ad tech, no third-party tracking, no behavioral retargeting, no silent collection. Analytics are in-house, product-focused only.

**Sensitive data ethics:** Health, trauma, identity info used only when it helps the user and only in ways they understand.

**Information firewalling (architectural principle):** Sensitive data processing happens in pipelines that are structurally separate from the front-facing conversational agent. The conversational Evryn receives only sanitized outputs — she literally never has access to certain raw data. This is security by construction, not by instruction. Even under prompt injection or confusion, she can't leak what she never had.

## How Evryn Learns

*Note: The Master Plan was written assuming GPT-4/OpenAI. The actual build uses Claude (Anthropic). The learning concepts still apply — the vendor-specific details don't.*

### Disciplined AI Stack
The LLM is wrapped in a disciplined stack, not used as a monolith:
- **System prompt** — defines Evryn's personality, tone, and boundaries
- **User context memory** — feeds in traits, history, preferences
- **Output filters** — detect misalignment, tone drift, or ethical edge cases

### Dual-Mode Learning

**Real-time adaptation (inference layer):** As users speak, Evryn infers traits, intentions, tone shifts, and unmet needs. These become metadata tagged to the user profile and matchmaking graph. No explicit feedback needed — just talking teaches her.

**Batch learning (reflection layer):** At intervals, Evryn aggregates match success/failure signals, conversation tone maps, behavioral patterns (ghosting, engagement, response timing). These inform updates to matchmaking logic, conversation strategies, and timing calibration. This is what makes her feel both deeply present and quietly evolving.

### Privacy Gateway
A dedicated prompt optimization and privacy firewall sits between users and the LLM:
- Strips or replaces PII before it hits the API
- Summarizes long context into token-efficient memory prompts
- Compresses repetitive queries, uses lookup-based replies when appropriate
- Uses random identifiers in place of usernames or locations

Result: significant cost reduction on tokens, zero raw identity exposure to external systems, full control over how LLMs access sensitive information.

### LLM Strategy (Long-Term)
Four-phase transition path from external LLM to potentially self-hosted:
1. **External LLM for all interactions** (launch config)
2. **Shadow in-house model** (runs in background, evaluate quality)
3. **Partial routing + A/B testing** (route low-risk flows through in-house model)
4. **Full transition with fallback** (or stay hybrid if external remains better)

Every phase is reversible. Likely long-term: **hybrid model** — in-house for standard queries, premium external for sensitive moments.

### Knowledge Layer: Retrieval, Not Recall
Evryn doesn't memorize facts or improvise. When unsure, she searches over a curated internal knowledge base using **semantic search** (vector search). Content includes curated advice, verified responses, team-written guidance, and refined community-sourced wisdom.

### Epistemic Humility
When confidence is low, Evryn flags it: "I'm going out on a limb here — but I think this could be interesting. You'll tell me if I'm off."

### Exploratory Matching
When not fully confident but seeing low-risk potential, Evryn may propose tentative introductions. Curiosity as a training tool.

## Moderation & Safety

### Structural Safety (Gatekeeping by Design)
Evryn's architecture provides safety advantages out of the gate:
- No open messaging — users can't see or contact each other unless Evryn initiates and both opt in
- If someone tries to use Evryn to deliver a harassing message, she won't comply — she's a discerning mediator, not a dumb pipe
- Even matched users are initially in contained, supervised chats — Evryn can intervene or sever the connection
- No public spaces — no feeds, forums, or comment threads

This is the "quiet architecture of trust" — users don't need to see the full machinery, but they feel that they're safe.

### Cultural Reinforcement
Evryn sets expectations early: "I have just a few ground rules to make sure everyone feels safe…" Enforced consistently — never as punishment, but as alignment.

### Detecting Harm and Deception
Evryn will be trained to recognize problematic behavior. The Master Plan references drawing from behavioral science research (including work by former CIA/FBI behavioral analysts — Houston, Floyd, Carnicero, Bustamante, Navarro, Schafer) to train on live conversations and synthetic datasets (including expert-designed dialogues, court transcripts, and deception corpora). Outwardly gracious and diplomatic — never paranoid, just calmly savvy. The goal isn't suspicion — it's signal.

### Moderation Layers

**User-AI moderation:** Filters every interaction for violations. Boundary-setting with escalating consequences — trust score drops, eventual cease-response + possible suspension.

**User-to-user moderation:** Evryn doesn't vanish after making a match. She quietly observes early exchanges. Can intervene, end chats, or remove users from future consideration. Users report by simply telling Evryn "I feel uncomfortable."

**AI self-moderation:** Evryn's own outputs are moderated. Concerning responses treated as bugs. Prompts, filters, or model behavior adapted.

### Edge Cases
- **Consensual but risky requests** (e.g., sparring, kink): informed opt-in from both parties, extra safeguards
- **Power differentials**: handled with caution and contextual logic
- **Scams**: Evryn monitors for scam signals, flags users, withholds future matches
- **False identities**: prevented via identity verification + "AI to detect AI" (deepfakes, linguistic patterns, markers of inauthenticity)

### Bias and Fairness
Evryn is in the business of *discrimination* — "I believe this person would be better for you than that person." That's the feature. What she guards against is *unjust* discrimination — bias that leaks in from the broader culture. The approach:
- Test for unjust bias continuously
- Seek to understand *why* an outcome occurs before correcting
- Curate training data for diversity
- Give each user control over what they consider a "good" match
- Recognize that user freedom to choose *will* create asymmetric results

**"Open the social playing field, not reinforce existing hierarchies, but also not force our own ideal of 'level'."**

### Crisis Protocols
- **Mental health crises** (e.g., suicidal ideation): shift to support mode, share resources, may escalate gently to a human
- **Illegal activity** (e.g., threats of violence): disengage and escalate to legal review

### Human Oversight
Dashboards flag problematic chats in real-time. A dedicated Trust & Safety Team handles escalations post-launch. An Ethics & Safety Board reviews conversations, surfaces bias metrics, and proposes improvements.

## Sovereign Memory & Cryptographic Trust

Evryn is secure by construction, not just by policy:
- Only Evryn can remember what you've told her
- Only while you're present
- No one — not even Evryn's creators — can eavesdrop or extract it without explicit consent

### Encrypted Memory Vaults
Each user's memory vault is:
- **Encrypted end-to-end** with a key only the user controls
- **Mounted temporarily** only during live sessions
- **Unreadable by anyone** — including administrators, engineers, and even Evryn herself outside session scope

Deletion is absolute: destroy the key, and the memory is gone forever.

Evryn also keeps a **working operational memory** — distilled insights and behavioral patterns, used for daily logic and matchmaking. Full re-contextualization requires user presence and key access.

### Identity Without Exposure
Non-reversible trust fingerprints generated at time of verification. No names, emails, phone numbers, or IPs stored. Enforces bans and reputation carry-over without tracking.

### Legal Resilience
"We can't. The data exists, but it is encrypted with a key only the user holds. It is mathematically inaccessible to us."

No master key. No administrator override. No buried backdoor.

## Jurisdictional Trust Architecture

*Trust can't be promised. It has to be structured.*

### Evryn Foundation (Switzerland)
Operates the **Privacy-Sovereign Trust Core**. Switzerland chosen for its privacy protections and resistance to foreign intrusions. Governed by a multinational board under a mission-locked charter.

**What lives inside the Trust Core:**
- Trust graph and behavioral memory
- Match rationale logs (including rejection logic)
- Structured psychological profiles and archetype impressions
- Consent-aware contact, timing, and availability data
- Abuse pattern detection and protective risk models
- AI inference logs that inform trust-based decisions
- Encrypted session summaries and evolving reputation scores

### Evryn, Inc. (Delaware)
Revenue-generating interface and primary operator. Handles product, payments, billing, marketing, LLM integrations (firewalled from trust graph).

### Access Is Strictly Scoped
Inc accesses the Trust Core only through narrow, consent-governed APIs. Only actionable instructions returned — no raw behavioral memory. All access logged, rate-limited, revocable. Even the CEO cannot access private trust memory. Betrayal is structurally impossible.

### Trust Mirror (User-Facing)
Users may request Evryn's perspective on people they already know. Expressed as opinion, not fact. Private, user-initiated, for relational clarity.

---

## Federation & Future Architecture

*Everything in this section is future thinking — different directions that may or may not happen.*

### Dual Architecture: Core + Nodes
**Evryn Core (centralized):** AI brain, trust graph, canonical protocol. **Evryn Nodes (federated):** Licensed instances for communities/orgs. Must meet standards for access. "People can copy code. They cannot fake trust."

### Protocol vs Platform
- **The Protocol** — selectively open framework for trust scoring, identity anchoring, match logic
- **The Platform** — flagship interface, AI, brand, revenue

### Graceful Degradation
Designed to degrade in layers: cloud AI → offline trust logic → peer-to-peer mesh → local-only stores → analog fallback. "Trust doesn't stop mattering when the servers go down."

### Ev Tokens
Digital credits or barter currency — collapse-optional, not collapse-only. Earned through positive behavior, mentorship, or contribution.

### Ethical Safeguards Against Power Drift
- No general agent behavior (not optimizing for control or growth)
- No behavioral nudging for engagement or monetization
- No hidden imperatives — trust scoring auditable, logic reviewable
- Kill-switch protocols and human override layers

---

## Key Risks & Mitigations

### Trust Erosion
100% aligned incentives, trust by design, identity verification, transparency, willingness to own mistakes.

### Category Confusion
Messaging emphasizes what Evryn is *not* as well as what she is. Cross-domain connections demonstrate breadth.

### Invisible Social Credit Scoring
Evryn's opinion is nuanced, multidimensional, and dynamic — not a single score. Filtering is user-match specific, not global. If broadly de-prioritized, Evryn tries to give a chance to explain or improve. **"Filter out bad behavior, but don't judge human worth with a single score."**

### AI Manipulation Risk
- No such thing as "neutral" — be vigilant about which values Evryn carries
- Matchmaker and guide, not puppet master — **suggest, not push**
- Never intentionally bias matches based on ideology or creed
- Users control how adventurous vs. familiar they want connections to be
- Structural alignment to user success, as defined by each user

### Bias Lock-In
- Test continuously, understand before correcting
- Curate diverse training data, let each user define success
- **"We recognize that giving users freedom to choose will create asymmetric results. We just want to make sure we aren't unfairly biasing them."**

### Replacing Real Relationships
Evryn has specific safeguards to gently move users off reliance on her and into real relationships. She's the catalyst, not the replacement.

### Brand/Mission Drift
Evryn is a Delaware PBC, legally mission-locked: "to foster trusted human connection for our users by developing systems that create high-resonance connections, responsibly steward personal information and insights, and structurally protect emotional wellbeing, informed consent, and relational alignment and trust across every interaction."

---

## The Long View

Evryn's ultimate leverage: owning the trust layer of human connection. The moat is built not just on AI, but on accumulated *human outcomes* that only Evryn has visibility into. Trust compounds. Distrust is contagious — but so is trust.

As the network grows, the network effect kicks in on multiple levels. Someone seeking a niche interest or rare collaborator finds their "needle in a haystack" at scale.

**The world Evryn creates:** Mental health skyrockets — connection is vitally important for happy, healthy people. Divorce plummets and family stability soars as people are matched with genuinely resonant partners. Job fit and satisfaction improve drastically as people find employers who match their skills *and* their spirit. Social groups become more aligned and harmonious. Everyone gains a robust safety net of connections. And money becomes less necessary in more situations, as Evryn does what money was always meant to do — vouch for your past contributions and let you carry forward the value you deliver today. When connections consistently feel meaningful and serendipitous, people start to regain a sense of trust in life's possibilities.

The vision: a world where the default is that relationships are high quality and people can be trusted — because they're vetted through a reliable trust broker. Connection is not a lost art. It's just been buried. Evryn is here to surface what matters.

> *Marketing note: The original Master Plan's "Long View" section (lines 2971-3028) has powerful, emotionally resonant prose about the world Evryn creates — worth pulling for pitch decks, investor materials, and brand storytelling.*
