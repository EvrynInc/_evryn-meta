# Evryn \- The Trust Layer for Human Connection

***Trusted introductions at scale***

Evryn is your personal AI guide who finds you those people who are ***just the right fit for you****.* No searching, no swiping, no scrolling, no feed \- not even a public profile. You just talk to her, she gets to know you and what you need…and then:

“*Hey, I found someone I think you’d love to meet*.”

---

(While Evryn’s ultimate vision is *universal scale*, *our launch* is **focused**: we ignite in one very specific **dense network**, where **trust is the lifeblood**, **introductions are everything**, and our **domain expertise** and **connections** amplify our launch. *More on that in a moment*.)

---

## The Problem

Too often, today’s connection tools deliver **noise instead of connection**. Dating and professional networking apps, feeds, and marketplaces optimize for **swipes, scrolls, and clicks** \- metrics of engagement on the platform, **not successful outcomes for users**. 

The result: **frustration, shallow interactions**, **eroded trust**, and **rising disconnection**. At the very moment people are **more lonely and disconnected than ever**, the tools meant to solve this often **compound the problem** instead.

---

## The Opportunity

Demand for **trust and belonging** is universal. **Billions are spent** each year to find the right people \- yet the more these platforms scale, the more they resort to tricks to keep people orbiting their platform. 

But we don’t need more time on an app. We don’t even need access to *more* people. We need ***the right*** ***people***. 

**We need someone we can genuinely trust,** to connect us to those rare people who are ***just the right fit for us***.

---

## What Evryn Is

*What if you had a friend who knew…everyone?*

Evryn is **your** **personal guide** \- **she gets to know you, protects you,** and connects you to people \- **only** when **the fit is *just right*** ***and she trusts them enough*** to connect them to you. 

Unlike traditional platforms, Evryn doesn’t monetize your time, attention, or data. She earns only when a **connection genuinely works for you**. This design ensures that **user outcomes and business outcomes remain *structurally* aligned**.

For users, Evryn feels less like an app and more like an **ally**: someone in the background who quietly works to bring the right people into your life \- **at every scale: soulmate, cofounder, crew, hookup \- even a plumber, or just someone to buy an old couch** \- Evryn will find those people who are just right for the journey you’re on \- or the journey you *want to be on*. 

---

## Trust as Structural Advantage

But to know how to introduce you to *just the right people for you*, Evryn needs to genuinely understand you. And for that to happen, you need to be able to **trust her**. So **she’s built from the ground up to *deserve* your trust:**

* **Evryn, Inc. is a Public Benefit Corporation**: for-profit, but mission-locked to protect user wellbeing.  
* **Aligned partners only:** we welcome strategic and capital alliances who strengthen our mission; if a deal threatens our ability to protect user trust and wellbeing, we pass \- even if the check is big.  
* **Zero dark patterns**: no ads, no data sales, no manipulative upsells.  
* **Consent-first matching**: nothing is ever shared without your *explicit* permission.  
* **Safety by design**: **Evryn only connects people she trusts.** And Evryn’s personal introduction is the only avenue to connect on the platform \- no public profile and no open messaging means there’s *simply no way* for pesterers, creeps, spammers, or scammers *to even find you*. **Evryn guards your gates, always**.  
* **No boosts, no shortcuts**: no one can buy their way into your awareness. 

Together, these choices form a **structural moat**. Evryn protects users, rewards good actors, and **filters out bad ones**. Over time, this builds a **compounding economy of integrity**, where genuine trust makes every connection stronger.

---

## Our Model: Revenue Through Results

Evryn’s model is simple: **three revenue streams,** aligned with one goal: **real, resonant outcomes**: those *just right* connections with *people you can trust*.

1. **Trust-Based Connections**  
   * You pay only when a connection feels right  
   * You pay what you believe is fair (see below why this works *better* than the traditional approach*)*  
   * 100% satisfaction guarantee  
2. **Post-Connection Transactions**  
   * Users can pay one another  
   * Evryn can facilitate this, and can take an agreed-upon percentage for some transactions  
3. **Participant-Based Business Access *(“Ads Without Ads”)***  
   * No one can boost their way into your attention \- because that would **break user trust** and taint Evryn’s reputation for introducing only who *you* need.  
   * So businesses can show up **only as users**.  
   * Like anyone else, they’re introduced only if they’re *trusted*, and if they’re the *best fit* for you in this moment.  
   * You can always stipulate what kind of users you’re unwilling to be connected to.

### Trust-Based Pricing

Uniform pricing and subscriptions don’t fit our model because they leave a *lot* of money on the table: a casual introduction might be worth $1 (or even free), while an executive connection could be worth $10,000…and everything in between \- the price points would be infinite. 

Even with a complicated tier structure, subscriptions would simultaneously **overprice low-value users**, causing churn, and **radically underprice high-value connections**, losing substantial upside.

Trust-Based Pricing elegantly **captures the full spectrum**:

* Users **pay what they believe is fair**, reflecting both the **value received** *and* the **relationship they want to build with Evryn**.  
* This approach **captures the entire long tail of value** while doubling as an **early trust signal** for Evryn, by beginning to show how each user **reciprocates value in relationships**.  
* **No money left on the table.** Every connection can yield its natural value.

We’re able to successfully offer this Trust-Based approach because:

1. **Delight drives referrals and repeat business**: Every customer leaves happy \- having only paid *exactly* what they believed was fair. And treating users like trusted allies *supercharges* organic growth.  
2. **Trust filters out bad actors**: Evryn lets users know early that she won’t connect those who abuse her good faith. Those who don’t heed the warning don’t get connected…**and the platform grows more trustworthy with their departure**.  
3. **Unit economics are compelling**: taking a gamble on a match costs us far less than the revenue the average successful match generates.

### Our Flywheel

Evryn is a **relationship engine with compounding value**:

* With legacy apps, value *ends* when the user gets what they want. With Evryn, value **compounds after it.**  
* You might initially be seeking a **soulmate**, but then you’ll need a wedding planner → then a midwife → a babysitter → and eventually a new job to accommodate your changing life…the value we deliver goes on and on.  
* And that’s just one dimension \- **the more Evryn knows you, the more verticals open up**.  
* **Every success fuels growth.** Every connection helps Evryn learn  → great matches bring more users  → a smarter Evryn plus more trusted users creates *even higher-quality* matches.

## Market Entry: Film Industry Launch — Pacific Northwest First (2026)

We’re launching in the **motion picture industry**, igniting in the **Pacific Northwest** and expanding to **Los Angeles** once proof of concept is in hand:

* **Acute Need**: in this industry, everyone is either clamoring for attention they can’t get, or drowning in attention they don’t want. Evryn solves both sides of this equation: each person finds their **needle in the haystack \- and nothing else.**
* **Highly Collaborative**: the industry mixes business, creative, social, romantic, and big money in ways no other industry does.
* **Dense Network**: each new customer knows hundreds of prime qualified leads \- and needs *many* types of connections.
* **Inadequate Tools**: today’s film collaboration tools are job boards, Facebook threads, DM chains, referral lists. It’s **almost entirely noise**. Evryn **clears the noise** and steps in as a **trusted connector**: someone who knows you and/or your project’s rhythm, creative style, emotional tone \- and introduces only when there’s genuine alignment.
* **Founder Advantage**
  * My network reach (78,000+ second-gen contacts in the industry) is the ignition point. Even with *conservative* funnel mechanics, this can bring our **first thousand-plus users pre-launch**, before marketing or ad spend.
  * My understanding of the industry’s structure and flows allows us to enter **key nodes at the right moment**, quickly spreading outward across networks and upward through verticals.
  * Beyond film, I have broad Seattle connections from nearly a decade in the fitness/wellness industry \- warm contacts across the city’s social fabric.
* **Why Pacific Northwest First**: While we had initially planned to launch in Los Angeles, the rapidly-evolving film landscape \- 41,000 LA entertainment jobs lost in three years, production fleeing to other states and countries, all four major union contracts expiring mid-2026 \- made us realize that concentrating in a single volatile market would be an unnecessary risk. Our pilot gatekeeper (Mark Titus), our film industry advisor (Megan Griffiths), and my own direct contacts are primarily Seattle-based. The warmest, shortest paths to our next gatekeepers run through Seattle. We focus density where the warm paths are, let growth spread wherever it spreads, and expand to LA when connections are in hand. If LA film has contracted further by then, we won’t have put all our eggs in one basket.
* **Seattle’s Own Acute Need**: the "Seattle Freeze" is real \- Seattle consistently ranks among America’s loneliest cities. Evryn’s positioning resonates especially hard here.
* **Cascade Potential**: capturing the PNW film community opens up:
  * **Los Angeles** (Justin, Mark, and Megan have many LA contacts \- and proof of concept makes the pitch)
  * **The global film industry** (LA is still where the density lives long-term)
  * **Everyone, everywhere** \- the entertainment industry megaphone effect: once stars, studios, and influencers meet Evryn, **word spreads like wildfire.**
* **Beyond Film**: while we’re getting proof of concept in Seattle and LA, we’ll be building waitlists in several other key cities, industries, and ignition points.

## Where We Are Now (2/28/26)

* The Team:  
  * **CEO**: Justin McGowan  
    * 30 years in the film industry, working as an actor, director, producer, and screenwriter \- creating original projects, supporting other independents, and delivering projects for Fox, Warner, Paramount, Lions Gate, Nintendo, Amazon, Flogging Molly, and Alicia Keys, among others.  
  * **Chief Technical Officer**:   
    * Until recently, we had what appeared to be a very promising CTO in trial, but he didn’t ultimately meet our standards, so we’re continuing to interview candidates (though with the expansion of reliable AI coding tools, this is becoming less and less of a concern)  
  * **AI Agent Team:** while trialing the CTO candidate, we had assembled a small team, but we’ve moved that team into advisory roles as we’ve found more and more instances where specialized AI Agents can do much of that work much faster, for a tiny fraction of the cost.   
  * **Operations Advisor**: Andrew Lester  
    * 20+ Years of Startup Growth, Operations and Project Management and Startup/Innovation Advisory.  
  * **Technical Product Advisor**: Salil Chatrath  
    * 10+ Years of Product Vision, Product Strategy, Roadmaps, User Research, Design thinking.  
  * **User Experience Advisor**: Manuele Capacci  
    * 15+ Years of design and brand identity, UX/UI strategy and design  
  * **Film Industry Advisor:** Megan Griffiths  
    * Award-winning director and executive producer whose credits span Amazon (*The Summer I Turned Pretty*), HBO, Netflix, and premier festivals (Sundance, Toronto, SXSW, Tribeca). As a leader in the Northwest film community and President of the Board at Northwest Film Forum, Megan provides high-trust insight into the needs, priorities, culture, and ethical expectations of filmmakers.  
  * **First Pilot User & Product Advisor:** Mark Titus  
    * Award-winning filmmaker, entrepreneur, and founder of August Island Pictures and Eva's Wild. Mark has directed brand films for Amazon, Microsoft, The Nature Conservancy, and the UN Development Programme, and helmed The Breach Trilogy. His collaboration with Mark Harmon on NCIS reached 23 million viewers. He's spoken at Cornell, Yale, and on the TEDx stage, and received the Daniel Housberg Wilderness Image Award for excellence in film.  
  * **General Counsel**:   
    * Andy Albertson and the extended team at Fenwick & West  
* **Internal MVP Validation** prepared us for **External Pilot:** We’ve already built *Evryn 0.1* \- a working conversational prototype that **gets to know you, guides onboarding, captures structured profiles and contact info, and even runs willingness-to-pay experiments.** She asks open-ended questions, follows up to uncover real needs, and holds the trust frame throughout.   
* **Evryn 0.2 Pilot:** We're currently in a pilot for v0.2 to test the matching proof of concept. Instead of our ultimate vision of matching many-to-many, this pilot solves the much more technologically-simple problem of matching the many to one: specifically, helping film industry gatekeepers like our pilot user Mark Titus (Seattle) manage overwhelming inbound volume. As a high-volume producer, Mark receives 6000+ emails every month from people seeking his attention. Evryn's job is to discover which of those people truly belong in his world. And the ones who don't aren't rejected: while not a fit for this gatekeeper, many will be excellent matches for others, so they're redirected into the platform as Evryn's first organic users.

## Capital Strategy & Financial Posture

Our capital plan is sequenced to stay lean, mission-aligned, and user-empowered. Since we began, the plan has been consistent, but recent advancements have begun to change our approach (see **Pivot** note below).

* **Raised to Date**: **$40K**: $15k founder capital; $25k from early angel investor.  
* **Near-Term Angels**: Approaching friends/family/smaller angels to secure funds for our first public-facing build.  
* **Larger Investors**: Once we’ve **fully validated the build architecture**, we’ll approach our short list of mission-aligned larger investors for more substantial investment.  
* **Crowdfunding / User Ownership**: Every new user has the opportunity to **pre-purchase discounted connection credits** prior to launch, and to become a **co-owner of Evryn** through a regulated crowdfunding platform.  
  * Both of these approaches extend the runway.  
  * Users with skin in the game are more likely to become die-hard ambassadors.

**AI Pivot** \- our pivot into AI infrastructure has substantially changed this picture. While the above is all still *directionally* accurate, our need for capital has drastically reduced. The full implications are still emerging, but the direction is clear: we can now build more, faster, with far less expense than originally planned \- and this allows us to be much more deliberate in our capital approach, partnering only on terms that protect the mission.

As mentioned above, we’re also signed with Fenwick & West \- more than just a very prestigious law firm, they’re a strategic partner, whose willingness to take us on as a client not only raises our profile but decreases our short-term burn rate (due to legal cost deferment), and increases our access to strategic and capital partners.

## Technology Architecture

Evryn’s technology is built to feel **simple and easy for the user** \- but under the hood, it rests on a layered system designed for safety, adaptability, and scale from day one:

* **Dialogue Brain (Conversational AI)** → Built to adaptively leverage leading conversational AI models, tuned for tone, memory, and trust. This makes Evryn feel like a wise personal guide, not an app.  
* **Connection Brain (Matchmaking Engine)** → Goes beyond similarity scoring; learns deep resonance. A hybrid of rules \+ heuristics \+ adaptive intelligence ensures she gets better and better at introducing you to only those people who feel *just right.*  
* **Care Brain (Relational Intelligence)** → Keeps the experience personal and caring: notices silence, remembers arcs, and knows when to check in or hold space.  
* **Trust Graph** → An evolving map that **remembers character**, and allows Evryn to connect people only in relation to how much she trusts them.   
* **Privacy Vault** → Consent-gated introductions and multi-layered encryption make misuse virtually impossible.  
* **Modular, Auto-Scaling Infrastructure** → Lean serverless design that grows with demand, built to scale globally.

Together, these systems ensure Evryn can **learn, adapt, and scale \- without ever betraying the foundation of trust**.

---

## Why Now

* **AI Shift: From Tools → Trusted Presence**  
  * For the first time, AI can act not just as a tool, but as a *trusted presence* \-  someone who listens, remembers, protects, and connects.   
  * Matching across dozens of nuanced dimensions was impossible with likes, stars, or similarity algorithms (what makes you an incredible fit for one person can sometimes be the very thing that made you a *terrible* fit for another).   
  * AI that can learn to understand relationships finally makes *true fit* possible.  
* **Cultural Fatigue with Extraction and Manipulation**  
  * Trust in platforms is collapsing \- because their incentives reward extraction over successful outcomes.  
  * Users are burned out on feeds, swipes, subscriptions, and ads.   
* **Demand For a *Safe, Outcome-Driven Connection* Service Has Never Been Higher**  
  * In the social sphere, a loneliness epidemic touches every part of human life, and is growing.  
  * And in the professional sphere, the landscape is changing quickly, and many people \- sometimes whole industries \- are being displaced, all at once. So many people need a way to form not just *connections*, but *trusted* connections quickly, as the networks they’ve long relied on start to break down.  
* **Competitors Can’t Follow**  
* **Evryn’s advantage compounds:** every connection makes Evryn better at finding just the right fit, but it also grows user trust \- both for other users, and for Evryn herself. Every time Evryn proves that you can really trust her and her connections, every time Evryn treats you like you really matter, every time Evryn delivers *real value* makes her harder to copy.  
* **Incumbents are trapped:** legacy platforms’ revenue is inextricably tied to keeping things broken. They’d have to stop trying to keep you addicted to their platform. They’d have to stop selling your data. To copy us, **they’d have to abandon the entire business model they rely on**. Then they’d have to **convince everyone they wouldn’t go back to their old tricks**.  
* **Upstarts can’t catch up:** copycats can mimic features, but **they can’t catch up** to **Evryn’s compounding trust graph** or **reputation.** They’ll **always be two steps behind,** because **real trust is *built*.**  
* **Once-in-a-Generation Window**  
  * Technology capability and cultural demand have aligned.   
  * Whoever wins trust at scale now will define the next decade of human connection.  
  * This is the moment Evryn was built for \- and the right strategic partners will help us seize it fully.

## The Long View

Most platforms are getting faster, smarter \- better at delivering *more of what’s broken*. More noise. More scrolling. More addiction to the platform. **More isolation dressed up as connection**.

Evryn was built for **something different**.

She’s present, she listens, remembers, protects \- and when it matters, she connects you to the people who are just right for you.

And with every connection, she gets better, more attuned, more precise \- because she’s learning what actually works \- what **true resonance** means, how **real trust** grows, how lives change.

As more people arrive, the network enriches. Connections get deeper. **Trust compounds**. Over time, Evryn becomes the **trust layer for human connection** the world over \- a system that remembers *who treats others well*, and connects them more often, and more meaningfully.

And when trust scales, so does belonging. So does opportunity. A world begins to emerge where **character becomes currency**, and good people have more good people in their corner.

We’ve taken the **safety and trust** that \- until now \- only worked in the smallest of communities, and found a way to bring it to the *whole world*.

---

We’re seeking aligned capital partners and strategic allies who believe ***genuine*** **trust is the foundation of the next era of human connection.**
