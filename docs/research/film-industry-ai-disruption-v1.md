## 1. Current State of AI Video/Film Tools

### The Landscape Has Exploded

If 2024 was "weird AI spaghetti eating videos" and 2025 was experimentation, 2026 is the year of professional adoption. The era of glitchy hands and morphing faces is largely behind us. But the story in early 2026 isn't just quality — it's *volume of competitors*, *geopolitical concentration*, and *a copyright battle that's splitting the market in two*.

**Two critical shifts happened in the last six months:**
1. **Native audio became table stakes.** Six months ago, most AI video models generated silent output. As of February 2026, four of the six major models generate synchronized audio natively — dialogue, sound effects, ambient audio, all from a single prompt. This is the difference between "cool demo" and "usable in production." [Source](https://medium.com/@xuxuanzhou2015/the-state-of-ai-video-generation-in-2026-5-shifts-that-actually-matter-c0a3c9e17180)
2. **7 of the top 8 AI video models are now Chinese.** This concentration has major implications for IP, copyright, regulation, and Hollywood's ability to control how its content is used. [Source](https://bonega.ai/en/blog/china-ai-video-dominance-kling-kuaishou-2026)

### Leading Tools (Feb 2026)

**Tier 1 — Professional-grade, pushing toward production use:**

- **ByteDance Seedance 2.0** (launched Feb 12, 2026) — The biggest new entrant and the most controversial. Generates cinema-grade video with synchronized audio, multi-shot storytelling, and phoneme-perfect lip-sync in 8+ languages — all from a single prompt. Supports 12 distinct input modalities (text, image, audio, video, motion capture, sketch, and more), giving creators the widest control over how they initiate and guide generation. Within days of launch, realistic clips of copyrighted characters went viral, triggering cease-and-desist letters from Disney, Paramount, Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery, Sony, and the MPA. ByteDance pledged to add safeguards. A Singapore-based studio described using it as "feeling like having a cinematographer assisting you."

- **Kuaishou Kling 3.0** (launched Feb 4, 2026) — Native 4K generation at 60fps — not upscaled, but resolved during diffusion at the pixel level. This is the first AI video model producing output that meets broadcast delivery standards without external upscaling. Best-in-class facial detail and human motion with phoneme-perfect lip-sync. Storyboard feature generates up to six camera cuts in a single generation with visual consistency across cuts. 60 million users. Kuaishou stock up 88%.

- **OpenAI Sora 2** — Clips up to 25 seconds with synchronized audio. January 2026 "character cameos" update introduced persistent character embeddings across scenes, addressing narrative continuity. Premiered production-ready shorts at Sundance 2026. Physics simulation capabilities. Leads in cinematic realism and narrative depth. [Source](https://studio.aifilms.ai/blog/sora-2-runway-gen-4-solve-jitter-problem-2026)

- **Runway Gen-4.5** — Solved the temporal consistency / "jitter" problem in Gen-4. Gen-4.5 adds "motion brushes" (direct AI exactly which part of the image should move). Top-rated video generation model. $315M Series E closed Feb 2026. **Lionsgate partnership** — Runway will leverage Lionsgate's 20,000+ film/TV library (including *The Hunger Games*, *Metropolis*) to build customized AI production models for storyboarding, background design, and VFX. Demonstrated on **NVIDIA Rubin platform** (50 PF inference compute per GPU) — signals the infrastructure for real-time, long-form, high-fidelity generation is arriving.

- **Google Veo 3.1** — Considered the best all-arounder. Strong prompt adherence, near-photorealistic quality, robust creative tools. Professional colorists reportedly struggle to distinguish Veo 3.1 output from shot-on-location material. [Sources: [pxz.ai](https://pxz.ai/blog/veo-31-vs-top-ai-video-generators-2026), [Medium](https://medium.com/@xuxuanzhou2015/the-state-of-ai-video-generation-in-2026-5-shifts-that-actually-matter-c0a3c9e17180)]

**Tier 2 — Significant players, advancing rapidly:**

- **Adobe Firefly** — The "commercially safe" lane. Trained exclusively on licensed Adobe Stock content (200M+ images, 22M+ videos) and public domain material — never on scraped internet data. Unlimited AI video generation for paid subscribers (Feb 2026). New "Quick Cut" beta auto-assembles uploaded footage into structured first edits. **Partnership with Runway** for exclusive AI video capabilities in Adobe apps (Premiere Pro, After Effects integration expected 2026). Adobe matters because it's already the professional toolchain — film professionals are *already in* Premiere Pro and After Effects.

- **Meta Movie Gen** — Produces short scenes with video, music, and sound effects from text inputs. Can edit existing videos and transform personal images into videos. Not yet widely available but signals Meta's direction. [Source](https://ai.meta.com/blog/movie-gen-media-foundation-models-generative-ai-video/)

- **Pika 2.5** — Most beginner-friendly ($8/month), fastest generation (30-40 seconds). Lower barrier to entry means wider adoption among non-professionals. [Source](https://zapier.com/blog/best-ai-video-generator/)

- **Luma Dream Machine (Ray 3)** — Key frames feature (upload start and end images, AI fills the middle). Strong for specific use cases. [Source](https://zapier.com/blog/best-ai-video-generator/)

- **CapCut** (ByteDance) — Has integrated Sora 2 and Veo 3.1 directly into its editing interface. Users generate high-quality clips and immediately cut them into TikTok-ready formats. This is the *democratization layer* — putting top-tier generation into the hands of millions of TikTok creators. [Source](https://manus.im/blog/best-ai-video-generator)

### The "Two Lanes" Split

The market is splitting along a fault line that matters enormously for the film industry:

1. **"Move fast" lane** — Models trained on broad internet data (Seedance, Kling, Sora, Runway). Maximum capability, legal risk. These tools can do more, but their training data provenance is contested or opaque. The Seedance copyright battle (see below) is the clearest example of the risk.

2. **"Commercially safe" lane** — Models trained exclusively on licensed content (Adobe Firefly). Less raw capability but commercial safety. Studios, agencies, and brands that need legal certainty are gravitating here. Adobe's existing dominance in professional creative tools gives this lane real traction.

This split forces a choice. Studios and production companies need to decide which lane they're in — or maintain parallel workflows. Film professionals who can navigate *both* lanes have a significant career advantage. [Source](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions/2026/gen-ai-video-disruption.html)

### What They Can Do

- **Short-form content** (social, ads, music videos): production-quality today
- **Commercials:** being used in production now — Sora 2 is powering real ad campaigns
- **Narrative shorts:** premiered at Sundance 2026
- **VFX/post-production augmentation:** rotoscoping, background removal, style transfer, in-betweens, motion cleanup — 30-50% timeline reductions reported ([Source](https://www.avgguild.org/post/animation-vfx-game-jobs-in-2026-what-s-changing-and-how-to-stay-hireable))
- **Broadcast-quality output:** Kling 3.0 generates native 4K at 60fps, meeting broadcast delivery standards
- **Storyboarding and pre-visualization:** Runway/Lionsgate partnership specifically targeting this
- **First-draft editing:** Adobe Quick Cut auto-assembles footage from raw clips + context prompt

### What They Can't Do (Yet)

- Feature-length films with narrative coherence across 90+ minutes
- Complex multi-character dramatic scenes with emotional nuance
- Reliable continuity across long-form projects (character cameos help, but aren't feature-length-ready)
- Replacing the creative vision of a director/writer for complex storytelling

### Trajectory

Quality is improving extremely fast. The gap between "AI short" and "feature film" is narrowing but still significant. Most industry observers expect AI-*assisted* (not AI-generated) feature films within 2-3 years — meaning AI handles specific tasks within a human-directed pipeline, not end-to-end generation. Fully AI-generated feature films of theatrical quality are likely 4-5+ years out, but the pace of improvement makes confident timelines impossible. [Source](https://naysblog.com/business/will2026betheyearwegetai-generatedmovies/)

The competitive advantage is shifting: it's no longer about *what AI can create* but about *how effectively creators direct it*. The professionals who thrive will be the ones who can use these tools as instruments, not replacements.

## 2. Industry Impact — What's Already Changing

### The Seedance Copyright Battle (Feb 2026)

This deserves its own section because it's a watershed moment.

Within days of Seedance 2.0's launch on Feb 12, users generated realistic clips of copyrighted characters — Friends characters reimagined as otters, a fight between Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise, Will Smith battling a spaghetti monster, and clips featuring Marvel, Star Wars, SpongeBob, South Park, Star Trek, The Godfather, and more.

Hollywood's response was swift and unified:
- **Disney** alleged Seedance was pre-loaded with a "pirated library" of copyrighted characters from Marvel, Star Wars, and other Disney franchises
- **Paramount, Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery, Sony** all sent separate cease-and-desist letters
- **The MPA** called it "unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale"
- ByteDance pledged to add safeguards to prevent generation of copyrighted content

[Sources: [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2026/02/bytedance-halt-seedance-legal-threats-disney-paramount-1236725770/), [Variety](https://variety.com/2026/film/news/paramount-disney-bytedance-cease-and-desist-seedance-ai-infringement-ip-1236663663/), [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/mpa-cease-and-desist-bytedance-seedance-2-0-1236510957/)]

**Why this matters for Evryn's GTM:** This battle will shape the regulatory and emotional landscape of AI in the film industry through 2026. Film professionals are watching — and many are angry. Evryn enters a market where trust in AI is actively being eroded by tools that appear to be built on stolen work. Evryn's positioning as a *trust-first* AI system is more differentiated than ever — but also means Evryn needs to be thoughtful about how she discusses AI with film professionals who may be hostile to the technology.

### Job Displacement

The numbers are stark:
- **LA County has lost 41,000 film and TV jobs** — a quarter of its entertainment workforce — in just three years (Bureau of Labor Statistics). [Source](https://theankler.com/p/fade-to-black-hollywoods-ai-era-jobs)
- **204,000 entertainment jobs** projected to be displaced by 2026 by some estimates; others estimate 100,000+ of the nation's 550,000 film/TV/animation jobs disrupted. [Source](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/204-000-film-jobs-will-disappear-by-2026-heres-what-to-do/id1828602619?i=1000725665901)
- **21% of film, TV, and animation jobs** in the U.S. could be consolidated, eliminated, or replaced by AI in 2026 (guild-commissioned report). [Source](https://www.avgguild.org/post/animation-vfx-game-jobs-in-2026-what-s-changing-and-how-to-stay-hireable)
- **17,000+ entertainment and media jobs** slashed in 2025 alone — an 18% increase over 2024. [Source](https://www.thewrap.com/industry-news/business/entertainment-media-layoffs-2025-analysis/)

### Jobs Most at Risk (Now)
- **Sound editors, 3D modelers, rerecording mixers, audio/video technicians** — a third of surveyed executives predicted displacement within three years
- **Sound designers, compositors, graphic designers** — a quarter predicted displacement
- **Entry-level positions broadly** — compositing, rotoscoping, background fills, rough edits. These first-rung tasks have been absorbed by AI tools; entry-level jobs may never come back in their traditional form
- **Voice actors, concept artists** — at the forefront of displacement
- **Junior animators** — tools like Autodesk FaceAnimator generate facial animation from audio, shifting the role from creation to correction

[Sources: [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ai-hollywood-workers-job-cuts-1235811009/), [Stop Motion Magazine](https://stopmotionmagazine.com/where-did-all-the-jobs-go/)]

### Jobs Safer for Now
- **Directors, writers, showrunners** — creative vision, narrative judgment, leadership (though WGA protections also help)
- **Producers** — relationship management, financing, project assembly
- **Cinematographers** — aesthetic judgment, on-set decisions (though AI is encroaching on post-production color work)
- **Senior VFX supervisors** — the role is shifting from "doing the work" to "directing AI tools that do the work"
- **New roles emerging**: AI supervisors, AI pipeline integrators, prompt engineers for film — studios hiring people who can use AI *within* a production pipeline

### Production Volume

- Overall U.S. production declined **40% from pre-strike levels** in 2024
- LA on-location filming dropped **22.4%** in Q1 2025, and **16.1%** for full-year 2025
- TV production fell **30.5%**, feature film production fell **28.9%** in Q1 2025
- TV episodes produced in 2024 fell by **nearly 5,000** compared to two years earlier
- California film/TV production jobs averaged **92,000 in Q1 2025** — down 35% from 2022

### Geographic Shift

LA is losing its grip on production. In Q1 2025, only **24 of 87 scripted projects** filmed at least partly in LA. **46% of all titles** began production entirely outside the country. Georgia, New Mexico, UK, Ireland, and Canada are gaining ground — driven by tax incentives and lower costs. [Source](https://senalnews.com/en/data/production-in-hollywood-plunges-to-historic-lows-as-nearly-half-of-us-projects-move-abroad)

### Streaming Landscape

Studios have pulled back from flooding the zone — content austerity, not peak TV. Exception: Netflix is increasing content spend from $17B to $18B in 2026. Studios are seeking profitability through bundles (Max + Disney+ + Hulu) rather than content volume.

## 3. Union & Contract Landscape

### Current Protections

**WGA (2023 contract):**
- AI cannot be credited as a "writer"
- Writers can't be forced to use AI tools
- AI-generated material cannot be used to undermine writer credits or compensation
- Studios must disclose when AI was used in material provided to writers
- Mutual disclosure requirements

**SAG-AFTRA (2023 contract):**
- "Digital Replicas" (AI recreations of real performers) require informed consent and compensation
- "Synthetic Performers" (fully AI-generated) covered by the contract
- Performers must consent before their likeness is used for AI training

**IATSE (2024 contract):**
- Any AI use must be covered by the union contract
- No member can be forced to enter prompts into an AI system that puts another member out of work
- Specific provisions around AI vary by craft

[Sources: [Perkins Coie](https://perkinscoie.com/insights/blog/generative-ai-movies-and-tv-how-2023-sag-aftra-and-wga-contracts-address-generative), [Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/news/iatse-ratifies-contract-amptp-1236068940/)]

### Contract Expirations (Critical Dates)

| Union | Current Contract Expires | Negotiation Start | Key AI Issues |
|-------|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **SAG-AFTRA** | June 30, 2026 | Preparations underway | Stronger AI protections, especially around training data and synthetic performers |
| **DGA** | June 30, 2026 | May 11, 2026 | AI's role in directing, post-production automation |
| **WGA** | May 1, 2026 | TBD | Expanding AI writing protections, enforcement of existing provisions |
| **IATSE** | July 31, 2026 | June 24, 2026 | Craft-specific AI protections, below-the-line job protection |

[Sources: [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/12/hollywood-unions-contracts-health-plans-1236655471/), [IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/news/business/sag-aftra-2026-contract-negotiations-what-to-expect-1235177515/), [Variety](https://variety.com/2026/film/news/hollywood-unions-bargaining-dates-1236626773/)]

**Studios are offering a $100M health plan lifeline in exchange for longer contracts (5-year instead of 3-year).** This is significant: if unions accept longer terms, it locks in whatever AI protections are negotiated for a longer period — but it also means the protections can't be renegotiated as AI capabilities rapidly evolve. [Source](https://deadline.com/2025/12/hollywood-unions-contracts-health-plans-1236655471/)

### Gaps in Current Protections
- Below-the-line crew (editors, compositors, colorists, sound designers) have weaker protections than writers and actors
- AI tools that *augment* existing roles (rather than replacing people outright) fall in a gray area
- Training data rights remain contentious — the Seedance 2.0 copyright battle is the most visible example, but Sora's use of copyrighted material is also under dispute
- Independent/non-union productions have no protections at all
- The "commercially safe" vs "open" split means union negotiations may need to address which *type* of AI tools are permissible

## 4. Industry Structural Factors

### The Entry-Level Pipeline Is Broken

This may be the most structurally significant change. Entry-level tasks that historically trained the next generation — compositing, rotoscoping, rough edits, background fills, in-betweens — are being absorbed by AI. The traditional career ladder (PA → assistant editor → editor → supervising editor) is losing its bottom rungs. If new professionals can't enter the industry, the talent pipeline breaks in 5-10 years. [Source](https://stopmotionmagazine.com/where-did-all-the-jobs-go/)

### New Roles and Adaptation

Studios are hiring people who can use AI *within* production pipelines — AI pipeline integrators, prompt engineers for film, AI supervisors. The shift: from "creating the work" to "directing AI tools and correcting output." Film schools and training programs are beginning to respond, but slowly. [Source](https://www.avgguild.org/post/animation-vfx-game-jobs-in-2026-what-s-changing-and-how-to-stay-hireable)

### The Geopolitical Dimension

With 7 of the top 8 AI video models now coming from Chinese companies, Hollywood faces a new dynamic: the most capable tools are being built by companies outside the US copyright framework. The Seedance copyright battle is the opening shot — but the broader pattern is that Chinese AI development is advancing faster than US regulation can respond. This creates a messy landscape where: (a) the most capable tools carry legal risk, (b) commercially safe alternatives (Adobe) are less capable, and (c) film professionals need to navigate both. [Sources: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/14/new-china-ai-models-alibaba-bytedance-seedance-kuaishou-kling.html), [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/91489530/chinas-new-ai-video-tools-close-the-uncanny-valley-for-good)]

### The Infrastructure Layer

NVIDIA's Rubin platform represents the infrastructure making all of this possible at scale. Runway's Gen-4.5 was ported from Hopper to Vera Rubin NVL72 in a single day, and the platform supports real-time, long-form, high-fidelity generation. This isn't just about one tool getting better — it's about the *ceiling* for all tools rising dramatically as compute infrastructure improves. [Source](https://runwayml.com/news/runway-partners-with-nvidia)

### Indie Filmmakers

Indie creators are adopting AI tools faster than studios — lower regulatory friction, no union constraints, and AI tools democratize production capabilities that previously required large budgets. This could accelerate the shift of content creation away from traditional Hollywood structures.

### LA Specifically

LA is being hit from multiple directions simultaneously: AI displacing jobs, production moving to lower-cost locations, streaming content pullback, and the January 2025 wildfire aftermath. The entertainment economy is under acute pressure. [Source](https://eurweb.com/l-a-entertainment-economy/)

## 5. What To Track Going Forward

### Leading Indicators

1. **SAG-AFTRA/DGA/WGA/IATSE 2026 negotiations** (May-July 2026) — the AI provisions in these contracts will shape the industry for 3-5 years
2. **Whether studios accept 5-year contracts** — locks in AI protections longer but prevents renegotiation
3. **Seedance/copyright resolution** — whether ByteDance's "safeguards" actually work, whether lawsuits are filed, and whether other Chinese AI tools face similar challenges
4. **AI video tool capability milestones** — watch for: multi-minute coherent scenes, consistent characters across a full short film, real-time rendering, feature-length coherence
5. **Adobe/Runway integration rollout** — when exclusive AI features hit Premiere Pro and After Effects, professional adoption accelerates
6. **LA production volume data** (FilmLA quarterly reports) — leading indicator of local industry health
7. **Entry-level job postings** — if these don't recover, the pipeline is structurally broken
8. **Independent film festival AI content** — quantity and quality of AI-assisted/generated shorts at Sundance, SXSW, Tribeca
9. **Studio AI tool adoption announcements** — internal AI pipeline builds, partnerships with AI tool companies (Lionsgate/Runway is the template)
10. **Chinese AI model releases** — the pace has been extraordinary (Kling 3.0 and Seedance 2.0 launched 8 days apart in Feb 2026). New models from Alibaba (RynnBrain), Kuaishou, ByteDance, and others will continue accelerating.

### Key Inflection Points

- **If unions accept 5-year contracts with weak AI protections:** accelerated displacement, industry restructuring within 2-3 years
- **If AI tools achieve 5+ minute coherent video:** commercials and short-form content fully automatable, major impact on production volume
- **If a major studio publicly ships an AI-heavy feature:** legitimacy watershed — accelerates adoption industry-wide
- **If LA tax incentives don't improve:** production flight continues regardless of AI
- **If Seedance-style copyright violations lead to regulation:** could slow Chinese AI tool adoption in professional contexts, strengthening the "commercially safe" lane
- **If Adobe/Runway integration delivers on promise:** professional AI adoption goes mainstream through the existing toolchain

### Scenario Planning

**12 months (Feb 2027):** Union contracts settled — the AI provisions are locked in. AI tools capable of producing high-quality 2-3 minute scenes with character consistency. Entry-level displacement continues. Production volume in LA stabilizes at a lower baseline. Below-the-line crew face increasing pressure. The "two lanes" have solidified — studios have chosen which tools they'll use.

**24 months (Feb 2028):** AI-assisted features in production at major studios. The "AI supervisor" role is established. Indie filmmakers routinely producing professional-quality shorts with skeleton crews. Traditional career paths are visibly disrupted — industry conversations shift from "will it happen" to "how do we adapt." Adobe's AI integration is deeply embedded in professional workflows.

**36 months (Feb 2029):** First widely-recognized AI-heavy feature released. Production economics fundamentally different — smaller crews, faster timelines, lower budgets (but potentially higher volumes if AI reduces cost barriers). The industry structure has visibly changed: fewer jobs, different jobs, new entry points. The copyright question around AI training data has been resolved (legally or practically).

## Key Takeaways for Evryn GTM

1. **The industry disruption makes Evryn MORE urgent, not less.** People need trusted connections more when their industry is in flux — both for traditional film work (which is scarcer) and for "what's next" transitions. Evryn should be positioned to serve both needs.

2. **The types of connections people need are shifting.** Traditional film collaboration ("find me a DP") is still needed but declining. Career transition connections ("I'm a VFX artist — what else can I do?"), cross-industry introductions ("my film skills transfer to gaming/advertising/tech"), and AI-related connections ("who can teach me AI pipeline integration?") are growing.

3. **Gatekeepers may get different inbound.** As the industry contracts, gatekeepers like Mark may receive more desperate/transition-oriented outreach alongside traditional pitches. Evryn's triage needs to account for this — someone who isn't a fit for Mark's film projects might be a perfect Evryn user for other connection types.

4. **The wave strategy may need adaptation.** The traditional hierarchy (actors → casting → directors → studios) is being disrupted. Some rungs (below-the-line crew) are shrinking. The wave may need to account for new roles (AI supervisors, AI pipeline integrators) and cross-industry transitions.

5. **Union contract expirations (May-July 2026) are a critical window.** The negotiations will dominate industry conversation. Evryn should be aware of the timeline — film professionals will be anxious and attention will be focused on AI's role in their future. This is both a sensitive period and a moment when trusted connections matter most.

6. **LA's decline as a production hub is real but not fatal for Evryn's GTM.** The film community in LA remains dense even as production moves elsewhere — people still live there, network there, and make decisions there. The connections Evryn brokers don't require production to happen locally.

7. **Evryn's "trust-first AI" positioning is more differentiated than ever — but also more sensitive.** The Seedance copyright battle has made "AI" a loaded word in the film industry. Evryn is not an AI video tool — she's a trusted connector who happens to be AI-powered. But film professionals who are angry about AI displacing their colleagues may reflexively distrust *any* AI system. Evryn's approach to this population should lead with trust, relationship, and human outcomes — not with "AI" as a feature.

8. **The "two lanes" split creates opportunity.** Film professionals need to navigate a complex landscape of tools, legal risks, and career transitions. Evryn can connect people who understand the "commercially safe" lane with people who need that expertise, and connect displaced professionals with new roles and industries. The complexity itself creates demand for a trusted connector.
