# Cross-Project Research

**How to use this file:** Index of research that applies across Evryn repos. Repo-specific research lives in topic files under that repo's `docs/research/` folder (e.g., `evryn-team-agents/docs/research/`). This file tracks cross-cutting findings and points to where deeper research lives.

*Add entries as research happens. Newest at top.*
